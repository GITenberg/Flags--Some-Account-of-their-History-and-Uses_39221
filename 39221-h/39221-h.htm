<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> a nation like ours, with a dominion so extended, and
with communication by sea and land with all parts of the
world, the flags under which ships sail and armies and
navies fight, cannot be without interest. Yet there are
few subjects in regard to which the means of information
are less accessible. The object of the present volume is
to give, in a popular form, some account of our own flags,
and of those of other nations, ancient and modern, with
some notices regarding the use of flags, in naval warfare
and otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">I have taken occasion to point out certain heraldic inaccuracies
in the construction of our national flag, and also
in the design on our bronze coinage. I shall be glad if
what I have written be the means, by directing public
attention to the subject, of effecting the correction of
these errors.</p>

<h2><a name="x01" id="x01"></a>FLAGS.<a name="page11" id="page11"></a></h2>

<p class="indent">On that morning when the news arrived from South
Africa of the disaster at Isandlana, there was general
mourning for the loss of so many brave men; but there
was mourning also of a different kind,&mdash;with some perhaps
even deeper&mdash;for the loss of the colours of the
24th Regiment. And yet, after all, it was only a bit of
silk which had been lost, having on it certain devices
and inscriptions&mdash;a thing of no intrinsic value, and which
could be replaced at a cost merely nominal. But it
possessed extrinsic qualities which could be measured by
no money value, and every one felt that the loss was one
to redeem which, or rather to redeem what that loss represented,
demanded, if necessary, the putting forth of the
strength of a great nation. And so, when it was found
that the colours never had been really lost&mdash;that they
had been saved by brave men who had laid down their
lives in defending them&mdash;there was throughout the
nation a feeling of intense relief that national honour had
been saved; a feeling of rejoicing far beyond what was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
evoked by the news of the capture of the Zulu king and
the termination of the war. So at sea. In our great
wars in which the navy of Great Britain played so prominent
a part, we became so accustomed to see the flag
of the enemy bent on under our own ensign, that if an
exceptional case occurred where the position of the two
flags was reversed, it went home to the heart of every
loyal subject with a pang which the loss of many ships
by storm and tempest would not have produced.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet how few of us know what the national colours are,
what the Union is, what the Royal Standard is. Not to
speak of civilians, are there many officers, in either the
army or the navy, who, without a copy before them, could
accurately construct or describe the flag of the nation
under which they fight, or tell what its component parts
represent? I doubt it. And, after all, they would not
be so much without excuse, for even at the Horse Guards
and the Admiralty, there is some confusion of ideas on
the subject. I have before me &quot;The Queen's Regulations
and Orders for the Army,&quot; issued by the Commander-in-chief,
in which flags which can be flown only
on shore are confounded with flags which can be flown
nowhere but on board ship. Yet the subject is really an
interesting one, and, connected as it is with national
history, it is deserving of a little study.</p>

<p class="indent">Flags are of many kinds, and they are put to many
uses. They are the representatives of nations; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
distinguish armies and fleets, and to insult a flag is to
insult the nation whose ensign it is. We see in flags,
says Carlyle, &quot;the divine idea of duty, of heroic daring&mdash;in
some instances of freedom and right.&quot; There are
national flags, flags of departments, and personal flags;
and as signals they are of the greatest value as a means
of communication at sea.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="x02" id="x02"></a>ANCIENT STANDARDS.</h2>

<p class="indent">It is chiefly of our own flags that I intend to speak, but
it may be interesting to say something of those which
were in use among the peoples of ancient history.</p>

<p class="indent">From the earliest times of which we have authentic
records, standards or banners were borne by nations, and
carried in battle. It was so in Old Testament times, as
we know from the mention of banners as early as the
time of Moses. They are repeatedly referred to by David
and Solomon. The lifting up of ensigns is frequently
mentioned in the Psalms and by the Prophets, while the
expression, &quot;Terrible as an army with banners,&quot; shows the
importance and the awe with which they were regarded.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Egyptian Standards.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">We find representations of standards on the oldest
bas-reliefs of Egypt. Indeed, the invention of standards
is, by ancient writers, attributed to the Egyptians. According
to Diodorus, the Egyptian standards consisted
generally of the figures of their sacred animals borne on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
the end of a staff or spear, and in the paintings at Thebes
we find on them such objects as a king's name and a
sacred boat. One prominent and much used form was a
figure resembling an expanded semicircular fan, and another
example shows this form reversed and surmounted
by the head of the goddess Athor, crowned with her symbolic
disk and cow's horns. Another figure also used as a
standard resembles a round-headed table-knife. Examples
of these, and of the sacred ibis and dog, are shown in
Fig. 1.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But on the Egyptian standards&mdash;those which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
were no doubt used
in Pharaoh's army&mdash;there
were various
other figures, including
reptiles such as
lizards and beetles,
with birds crowned
with the fan-like ornament
already referred
to. A group
of these is given in
Fig. 2; but they had
many other forms. Those represented in Fig. 3, and
which show some curious
symbolic forms,
are taken from the
works of Champollion,
Wilkinson, and
Rosellini.</p>

<p class="indent">That the Hebrews
carried standards after
the exodus is, as I
have already said, certain,
and the probability
is that they derived
the practice
from the Egyptian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
nation, from whose bondage they had just escaped, for they
bore as devices figures of birds and animals, and also human
figures, just as the Egyptians did. One of the earliest of
the divine commands given to Moses was that &quot;every
man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard
with the ensign of their father's house.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The <i>ensign</i>
probably meant the particular device borne upon the
standard by each tribe; and tradition has assigned as these
the symbolic cherubim seen in the visions of Ezekiel and
John&mdash;Judah bearing a lion, Reuben a man, Ephraim an
ox, and Dan an eagle. This is the opinion of the later
Jews. The Targumists believe that, besides these representations,
the banners were distinguished by particular
colours&mdash;the colour for each tribe being analogous to that
of the precious stone in the breastplate of the high-priest.
They consider also that each standard bore the name of
the tribe with a particular sentence from the Law. The
modern opinion, however, is that the Hebrew standards
were distinguished only by their colours, and by the name
of the tribe to which each belonged.</p>

<p class="indent">Apart from the direct Scripture evidence on the subject,
this bearing of distinguishing standards is what might be
expected in a military organization such as that of the
Israelites, just as we find them using warlike music. It
is interesting to note that even the particular trumpet
signals to be used for the assembling and advance of the

</div>

<p class="indent">The standards of the Assyrians, like those of the
Egyptians, consisted of figures fastened on the end of
spears or staffs; but of these very few varieties have been
yet discovered. Layard says<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that &quot;standards were carried
by the Assyrian charioteers. In the sculptures they
have only two devices [Figs. 4, 5, 6]: one a figure, probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
that of a divinity, standing on a bull and drawing a bow;
in the other, two bulls running in opposite directions. These
figures are inclosed in a circle and fixed to a long staff
ornamented with streamers and tassels. The standards
appear to have been partly supported by a rest in front
of the chariot, and a long rope connecting them with the
extremity of the pole. In a bas-relief of Khorsabad this
rod is attached to the top of a standard.&quot; The interesting
illustration given in Fig. 6 is from a sculpture in which
these standards are represented with the figures of the
standard-bearers, and
in which also the
ropes or supports of
the staff are indicated.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Standard of Pacha.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The Persians, like the Assyrians, carried their standards,
in battle, on staffs or spears attached to chariots. Their
royal standard was a golden eagle with wings expanded
carried on the end of a spear. They had also a figure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
the sun which they used on great occasions when the
king was present with the army. Quintus Curtius describes
one of these figures of the sun, inclosed in a
crystal, as making a very splendid appearance above the
royal tent. But the proper royal standard of the Persians
for many centuries, until the Mahommedan conquest, was
a blacksmith's leather apron, around which the people had
been at one time rallied to a successful opposition against
an invader (Fig. 8). Many other national standards have
had their origin in similar causes. Something which was at
hand was seized in an emergency,
and lifted up as a rallying
point for the people, and afterwards adopted from the
attachment which clung to it as an object identified with
patriotic deeds. In this way originated the horse-tails
borne as a standard by the modern Turks (Fig. 9). Under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
the old system, among that people, the distinction of rank
between the two classes of pachas was indicated by the
number of these horse-tails, the standards
of the second class having only
two tails, while those of the higher
had three. Hence the term a pacha
of two tails or three. A further mark
of distinction appears to have been
the elevation of one of the tails above
the others, and the surmounting of
each with the crescent, as shown in
Fig. 10.</p>

<p class="indent">The Romans had various forms of
standards, some composed entirely of
fixed figures of different devices,
including figures of animals. The eagle, according to
Pliny, was the first and chief military ensign. In the
second consulship of Caius Marius (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 104) the
eagle (Fig. 11) alone was used, but at
a subsequent period some of the old
emblems were resumed. These were
the minotaur, the horse, and the wild
boar; and on the Trajan Column we
find as one of their standards the historic
wolf (Fig. 12).</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;Roman Standards.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">One of the most ancient of the
Roman standards had an origin similar to that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
apron of the Persians and the horse-tails of the Turks.
It was derived from a popular rising which took place
in the time of Romulus, and was composed of a wisp of
hay attached to the end of a pole (as seen in Fig. 13),
and carried into battle.
From its name, <i>manipulus</i>,
the companies of
foot soldiers, of which
the <i>hastati</i>, <i>principes</i>, and
<i>triarii</i> of each legion
were composed, came to
be called maniples&mdash;<i>manipuli</i>.
Another standard
borne by the Romans
was a spear with a piece
of cross wood at the top
with the figure of a hand
above, and having below a
small round shield of gold
or silver, as shown in Fig.
13. On this circle were at
first represented the warlike deities Mars and Minerva,
but after the extinction of the commonwealth it bore the
effigies of the emperors and their favourites. From these
coin-shaped devices the standards were called <i>numina
legionum</i>. The eagle was sometimes represented with a
thunderbolt in its claws, of which an example will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
seen in Fig. 13. Under the later emperors it was carried
with the legion, which was on that account sometimes
termed <i>aquila</i>. The place for this standard was near
the general, almost in the centre.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 15.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Another common form of the Roman standard consisted
in a variety of figures and devices exhibited on the same
staff, one over the other. On the
top of one of these will be seen a
human hand (Fig. 14). This by
itself, or inclosed, as here, within
a wreath, was, as I have mentioned,
a frequent device, and was
probably of oriental origin. It
is also found as a symbol in
ancient Mexico; and at the present
day the flagstaffs of the
Persians terminate in a silver
hand. Among the pieces composing
this form of standard are
also found the eagle, and figures
of the emperors inclosed in circles,
with other devices (Fig. 15). A
common form is that numbered 5 in Fig. 16. This
example is taken from the Arch of Titus. The eagle
surmounting the thunderbolt with the letters S P Q R
(No. 3) was also a common form. The letters indicate
<i>Senatus Populusque Romanus</i>. The examples Nos. 1
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
and 2 in Fig. 16 are from Montfaucon. No. 4 is given by
Mr. Hope.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>vexillum</i> of the Romans was a standard composed
of a square piece of
cloth fastened to a
cross bar at the top
of a spear, sometimes
with a fringe all round
as shown in Fig. 13,
and sometimes fringed
only below (No. 4,
Fig. 16), or without
a fringe, but draped
at the sides (Fig. 17).
When placed over
the general's tent it
was a sign for marching, or for battle.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>labarum</i> of the emperors was similar
in form, and frequently bore upon it a representation
of the emperor, sometimes by
himself and sometimes accompanied by the
heads of members of his family. It has
been said that the Emperor Constantine
bore on the top of his standard the sign of the
cross, but this was not so. The cross at
that time was known only as a heathen emblem, and was
not adopted by the Christians till afterwards. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
which Constantine bore was what in his time was the only
recognized Christian emblem&mdash;the first two letters of
our Lord's name (Fig. 18)&mdash;the Greek X (English
CH) and P (in English R). The <i>labarum</i>
was made of silk. The term is sometimes
used for other standards, and its form may
still be recognized in the banners carried in
ecclesiastical processions. The <i>labarum</i>, like
the <i>vexillum</i>, had sometimes fringes with tassels
or ribbons.</p>

<p class="indent">The dragon, an ensign of the Parthians,
was adopted by the Romans as the standard
of their cohorts. It appears as such
on the Arch of Severus. It was also the
device of the Dacians, and indeed seems
to have been a general ensign among barbarians.
Besides being carried as a separate
figure in metal&mdash;as shown in Fig. 19&mdash;it
was frequently embroidered in cotton or
silk on a square piece of cloth borne on a
cross bar elevated on a gilt staff; the bearer
being called <i>draconarius</i>. From the Romans
the dragon came to the Western Empire.
It was borne by the German Emperors.
In England also it was for some
time the chief standard of the kings, and
of the Dukes of Normandy, and according to Sir Richard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
Bacon it was the standard of Utor Pendragon, king of
the Britons.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The golden dragon was in the eighth
century the standard of Wessex, and it was displayed in
a great battle in 742 when Ethelbald, the king of Mercia,
was defeated. It was also borne on a pole by King
Harold as a standard. It was borne by Henry VII. at
Bosworth Field, and at a later date it was carried as a
supporter by Henry VIII. and Edward VI., and also by
Elizabeth. In many of the illuminations of MSS. in the
fifteenth century we also find a gold dragon on a red
pennon, as one of the ensigns in the French armies.</p>

<p class="indent">The infantry flag of the Romans was red, that of the
cavalry blue, and that of a consul white.</p>

<p class="indent">The banners of the Parthians resembled those of the
Romans, but they were more richly decorated with gold
and silk.</p>

<p class="indent">In early times the Greeks carried as a standard a piece
of armour on a spear, but although they had an ensign,
the elevation of which served as a signal for giving battle
either by land or by sea, they were not regularly marshalled
by banners. In their later history their different
cities bore different sacred emblems. Thus the Athenians
were distinguished by the olive and the owl, and the
Corinthians by a Pegasus.</p>

<p class="indent">At what time the form of standard which we call a flag
was first used is not known. It was certainly not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
earliest but the ultimate form which the standard assumed.
The original form was some fixed object such as we have
seen on the Egyptian and Roman examples, and the
vexillum and labarum were transitional forms. The
waving flag is said to have been first used by the Saracens.
Another account is that the flag first acquired its present
form in the sixth century, in Spain. The banners which
Bede mentions as being carried by St. Augustine and his
monks, when they entered Canterbury in procession, in the
latter part of the sixth century, were probably in the form
of the Roman labarum. He calls them little banners on
which were depicted crosses.</p>

<p class="indent">Of our own national flags the earliest forms were those
which bore the cognizance of the ruler for the time being.
The well-known ensign of the Danes at the time of their
dominion in Britain was the raven. The dragon, as we
have seen, was in the eighth century the cognizance of
Wessex, and the Saxons had also on their standards a
white horse. Of our later royal standards and those
of other nations I shall speak afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">The forms of flags in our own country have varied
very much. It was not till the time of the Crusades,
when heraldry began to assume a definite form, that they
became subject to established rules. Up to that period
flags were, as a rule, small in size, and they usually terminated
in points, like the more modern pennon. Such
were the standards of the Normans. At the Battle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
the Standard in 1138 the staff of the English standard
was in the form of the mast of a ship, having a silver pyx
at the top, containing the host, and bearing three sacred
banners dedicated respectively to St. Peter, St. John of
Beverley, and St. Wilfrid of Ripon, the whole being
fastened&mdash;like the standards of the Persians and Assyrians&mdash;to
a wheeled vehicle.</p>

<p class="indent">From an early period the practice has prevailed of
blessing standards, and this has continued to our own
day in the British army when new colours are presented
to a regiment&mdash;there being a special form of service at
the consecration. The banner of William the Conqueror
was one blessed and sent to him by the pope. Indeed,
it has been the practice of the popes in every age to give
consecrated banners where they wished success to an
enterprise.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="x03" id="x03"></a>DIFFERENT KINDS OF FLAGS&mdash;GONFANON&mdash;PENNON&mdash;PENONCEL.</h2>

<p class="indent">In the middle ages almost every flag was a military
one. A very early form, borne near the person of the
commander-in-chief, was the Gonfanon. It was fixed in
a frame made to turn like a modern ship's vane. That
of the Conqueror, as depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, had
three tails, and was charged with a golden cross on a
white ground within a blue border.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
Of other forms of flags the principal varieties were the
penoncel, the pennon or guidon, the banner, and the
standard.</p>

<p class="indent">The Pennon was a purely personal flag, pointed, borne
below the lance-head by a knight-bachelor, and charged
with the arms, or crest, and motto of the bearer. But in
early times no knight displayed a pennon who had not
followers to defend it&mdash;the mounting of this ensign being
a matter of privilege, not of obligation. The order of
knight-bachelor was the most ancient and originally the
sole order, being the degree conferred by one knight on
another without the intervention of prince, noble, or
churchman, and its privileges and duties approached
nearly to those of the knight-errant.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The Penoncel, which was carried by the esquire, was
the diminutive of the pennon, being one-half its breadth.
It was borne at the end of a lance, and usually bore the
cognizance or &quot;avowrye&quot; of the bearer. This flag was
not carried by the esquire after the fight began, but was
then either held by an inferior attendant, or put up by the
owner's tent.</p>

<h2><a name="x04" id="x04"></a>BANNERS.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Banner was the flag of a troop, and was borne by
knights, called after it bannerets, an order which held
a middle rank between knights-bachelors and the barons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
or great feudatories of the crown. The flag of a knight-banneret
was square at the end, but not an exact square
on all the sides. The perfectly square banner was the
flag of a baron, and of those of higher rank.</p>

<p class="indent">It was only on the field of battle, and in presence of the
royal standard, that a knight-banneret could be created.
It was the custom for the commander of the host thus
to reward the distinguished services of a knight-bachelor
bearing a pennon, and he did so by tearing off the &quot;fly,&quot;
or outer part of that flag, and by so doing giving it a
square form, thus making it a banner, and its bearer a
knight-banneret. The ceremony is thus described by
Blome.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> &quot;The king (or his general), at the head of the
army, drawn up into battalia after a victory, under the
royal standard displayed, attended with all the field-officers
and nobles of the court, receives the knight led
between two renowned knights or valiant men-at-arms,
having his pennon or guydon of arms in his hand;
and before them the heralds, who proclaim his valiant
achievements, for which he deserves to be made a knight-banneret,
and to display his banner in the field. Then
the king (or general) says unto him <i>Advances toy,
Bannaret</i>, and causes the point of his pennon to be rent
off; and the new knight, having the trumpets before him
sounding, the nobles and officers accompanying him, is
remitted to his tent, where they are nobly entertained.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>But knights were thus promoted before a battle as
well as after it. Froissart relates the manner in which
the celebrated Sir John Chandos was made banneret by
the Black Prince before the battle of Navarete. The
whole scene forms a striking picture of an army of the
middle ages moving to battle. Upon the pennons of
the knights, penoncels of the squires, and banners of the
barons and bannerets, the army formed, or, in modern
phrase, dressed its line. The usual word of the attack was,
&quot;Advance banners in the name of God and Saint
George.&quot; &quot;When the sun was risen,&quot; writes Froissart,
&quot;it was a beautiful sight to view these battalions, with
their brilliant armour glittering with its beams. In this
manner they nearly approached to each other. The
prince, with a few attendants, mounted a small hill, and
saw very clearly the enemy marching straight towards
them. Upon descending this hill he extended his line of
battle on the plain, and then halted. The Spaniards,
seeing the English halted, did the same, in order of
battle; then each man tightened his armour and made
ready as for instant combat. Sir John Chandos then
advanced in front of the battalions, with his banner
[pennon] uncased in his hand. He presented it to the
prince, saying 'My lord, here is my banner; I present it
to you that I may display it in whatever manner shall be
most agreeable to you, for, thanks to God, I have now
sufficient lands that will enable me so to do, and maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
the rank which it ought to hold.' The prince, Don
Pedro being present, took the banner in his hands, which
was blazoned with a sharp stake gules, on a field argent;
and after having cut off the tail to make it square, he
displayed it, and, returning it to him by the handle, said,
'Sir John, I return you your banner: God give you
strength and honour to preserve it.' Upon this Sir John
left the prince, and went back to his men with the banner
in his hand.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p class="indent">A banneret was expected to bring into the field at
least thirty men-at-arms&mdash;that is, knights or squires
mounted&mdash;at his own expense; and each of these, again,
besides his attendants on foot, ought to have had a
mounted crossbow-man, and a horseman armed with a
bow and axe&mdash;forming altogether a large troop. The
same force might be arrayed by a knight under a pennon,
but his accepting a banner bound him to bring out that
number at least. After the reign of Charles IV. this
obligation fell into disuse in France, and in England, soon
after that time, it also ceased to be observed.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Judging,
however, from the contemporary heraldic poem of the
&quot;Siege of Carlaverock&quot; (June, 1300), it would appear that
early in the fourteenth century there was a banner to
every twenty-five or thirty men-at-arms. At that period
the English forces comprised the tenants <i>in capite</i> of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
crown, who were entitled to lead their contingent under a
banner of their arms&mdash;either by themselves or under a
deputy of equal rank. Thus at Carlaverock the Bishop
of Durham sent 160 of his men-at-arms, with his banner
intrusted to John de Hastings. But his banner on this
occasion bore, not the cognisance of the see, but simply
his paternal arms. Having mentioned this old poem&mdash;in
which the arms of every banneret in the English army
are accurately blazoned&mdash;it may be interesting to give
one of the opening verses, as an example of the Norman
French of the period&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">In the Scottish wars, the banner of St. Cuthbert was, in
the English army, carried by a monk. This continued to
be done so late as the reign of Henry VIII. In the
same way the banner of St. John of Beverley was carried
by one of the vicars of Beverley College&mdash;who, by the
way, received eight pence halfpenny per diem as his
wages, to carry it after the king&mdash;a large sum in those
days&mdash;and a penny a day to carry it back.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The bearer

of a banner, or bannerer as he was called, was in these
early times a very important personage. In the old
paintings in MSS. the persons holding the national or
royal banners are generally represented in the same kind
of armour as the chief leaders. And they were liberally
rewarded for their services. In 1361 Edward III. granted
Sir Guy de Bryon 200 marks a year for life for having
discreetly borne the king's banner at the siege of Calais
in 1347.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p class="indent">We learn from the &quot;Siege of Carlaverock&quot; that a pennon
hung out by the besieged was the signal for a parley.
When the castle surrendered there were placed on its
battlements, we are told, the banners of the king, of St.
George, of St. Edmund, and St. Edward, together with
those of the marshall and constable of the army. To
these were added the banner of the individual to whose
custody the castle was committed. But it is doubtful
whether in the fifteenth century any others but those of
the king and St. George were affixed to captured fortresses.</p>

fifteenth century heralds, when despatched on missions,
appear to have carried a banner bearing their sovereign's
arms. Banners were also for a long time used at funerals.

<h2><a name="x05" id="x05"></a>STANDARDS&mdash;THE ROYAL STANDARD.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Standard was a large long flag, gradually tapering
towards the fly. According to the representation of a
standard, in a heraldic MS. at least as early as the
reign of Henry VII., in the British Museum, it was not
quite so deep but very much longer than a banner,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and
it varied in size according to the rank of the owner. In
England that of a duke was seven yards in length, of
a banneret four and a half, and of a knight-bachelor four
yards.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The Royal Standard of England, when the sovereign
in person commanded the army, appears to have been of
two sizes. According to the MS. referred to, one of these
standards is to be &quot;sett before the Kynges pavillion or
tente, and not to be borne in battayle, and to be in length
eleven yards.&quot; The other&mdash;&quot;the Kynges standard <i>to be
borne</i>&quot;&mdash;is to be &quot;in lengthe eight or nine yards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Royal Standard is a flag personal to the sovereign.
It was not always exclusively so, for in the seventeenth
century the Lord High Admiral, when personally in
command of the fleet, and sometimes also other commanders-in-chief,
flew as their flag of command, not the
Union, but the Standard. It was so flown at the main
by the Duke of Buckingham as Lord High Admiral, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
the occasion when he disgraced the English flag in the
unfortunate expedition against the Isle of Rhé in 1627.
But now the Royal Standard is used only by the sovereign
in person, or as a decoration on royal fête days.
There are depicted on it the royal arms, which have had
various forms in different periods of our history. The
standard of Edward the Confessor was azure a cross floré
between five martlets, or. The arms of William Duke of
Normandy, emblazoned on his standard, were two lions,
and they were borne by him and his successors, as the
royal arms of England, till the reign of Henry II. That
monarch married Eleanor, daughter and co-heiress of the
Duke of Aquitaine, whose arms&mdash;one lion&mdash;Henry added
to his own. Hence the three lions <i>passant gardant in
pale</i>, borne ever since as the ensigns of England. These
now occupy the first and fourth quarters of the standard,
but they did not always do so. The fleurs-de-lis of
France were, till a comparatively recent period, quartered
with the English arms, having been first borne by
Edward III. when he assumed the title of King of
France. Many noble families, both in this country and
on the Continent, have quartered the French lilies to show
their origin, or in acknowledgment of the tenure of important
fiefs there. Among the last may be mentioned the
arms of Sir John Stewart of Darnley, who obtained from
Charles VII. the lands and title of Aubigny, and the right
to quarter the arms of France with his own. But in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
these instances the fleurs-de-lis occupied a secondary
place. So if Henry II. had desired merely to show his
French connection, by maternal descent, he would have
placed them in the second and third quarters. But he
placed them in the first quarter, as arms of dominion, to
indicate that he claimed the kingdom by right, and our
sovereigns continued this idle pretence till so late as the
reign of George III. It was not till the union with Ireland
that it was discontinued.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the English kings bore personal standards
besides the flag of their own arms. Edward IV., besides
his royal standard, generally bore a banner with a white
rose. Henry VII. at the battle of Bosworth Field had
three personal standards, in addition to the standard of his
own arms. The blazon of these three, and how the king
disposed of them after the battle, are thus described in a
contemporary manuscript:&mdash;&quot;With great pompe and
triumphe he roade through the Cytie to the Cathedral
Church of St. Paul where he offered his iij standards.
In the one was the image of St. George; in the second
was a red firye dragon beaten upon white and green sarcenet;
the third was of yellow tarterne [a kind of fine
cloth of silk] in the which was painted a donne Kowe.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Royal Standard of Scotland was a red lion rampant
on a gold field within a red double tressure, floré
counterfloré, of which the origin is veiled in the mists of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
antiquity. Our great heraldic authority, Nisbet, in common
with earlier writers, adopts the tradition which
assigns the assumption of the rampant lion to Fergus I.,
who is alleged to have flourished as King of Scotland
about 330 years before Christ. He also refers to the
celebrated league which Charlemagne is said to have
entered into in the beginning of the ninth century with
Achaius, King of Scotland, on account of his assistance
in war, &quot;for which special service performed by the Scots
the French king encompassed the Scots lion, which was
famous all over Europe, with a double tressure, flowered
and counterflowered with flower de luces, the armorial
figures of France, of the colour of the lion, to show that
it had formerly defended the French lilies, and that these
thereafter shall continue a defence for the Scots lion and
as a badge of friendship.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> On the other hand Chalmers
observes that these two monarchs were probably not even
aware of each other's existence, and he suggests that the
lion&mdash;which first appears on the seal of Alexander II.&mdash;may
have been derived from the arms of the old Earls of
Northumberland and Huntingdon, from whom some of
the Scottish kings were descended. He adds, however,
that the lion was the cognisance of Galloway, and perhaps
also of all the Celtic nations. Chalmers also mentions an
&quot;ould roll of armes,&quot; preserved by Leland, said to be of
the age of Henry III. (1216), and which the context
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
shows to be at least as old as the reign of Edward I.
(1272), in which the arms of Scotland are thus described:

<p class="indent">On the accession of James I. the Royal Standard of
England was altered. The arms of France and England
quarterly appeared in the first and fourth quarters, those
of Scotland in the second, and in the third the golden
harp of Ireland, which had taken the place of the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
crowns. But an exception occurred in the case of William
III., who, on his landing in England, had a standard bearing
the motto, &quot;The Protestant Religion and Liberties
of England,&quot; and, under the royal arms of England,
instead of &quot;Dieu et mon Droit,&quot; the words &quot;And I will
maintain it.&quot; Afterwards he impaled on his standard the
arms of Mary with his own. They are represented in
this form in a MS. of the Harleian Library, on a banner
per pale orange and yellow. After his elevation to the
throne William placed over the arms of the queen, which
were those of her father James II., his own paternal

<p class="indent">George III. when he left out the ensigns of France
marshalled on his standard those of his Germanic states
in an escutcheon of pretence&mdash;a small shield in the centre
point. This was omitted on the accession of Queen
Victoria, who bears on her standard the arms of England
in the first and fourth quarters, Scotland in the second,
and Ireland in the third. (See Plate IV. No. 1, p. 108.)</p>

<p class="indent">But while the Royal Standard was, on the accession of
James I., altered for England in the way I have described,
it was displayed according to a different blazon in Scotland.
For a long period, whenever the standard was
used to the north of the Tweed, the Scottish arms
had precedence by being placed in the first and fourth
quarters. On the great seal of Scotland this precedence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
is still continued, and the Scottish unicorn also
occupies the dexter side of the shield as a supporter.
But on the standard the arms of Scotland have now lost
their precedence, those of England being placed in the
first quarter, and although there has been much controversy
on the subject, I agree with Mr. Seton<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> that it is
better that the arrangement should be so. The standard
is the personal flag of the sovereign of one united kingdom,
and heraldic propriety appears to require that only
one unvarying armorial achievement should be used on
it&mdash;that of the larger and more important kingdom taking
precedence, although Nisbet<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> claims precedence for the
Scottish arms on the achievement of Great Britain as
those of &quot;the ancientest sovereignty.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I certainly do not
agree with Mr. Seton, however, that either in the arms
or supporters precedence ought to be granted to England

classical lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">The supporters of the Scottish arms were two unicorns.
In England, previous to the accession of the
Stuarts, the supporters of the royal arms were changed
at the caprice of the sovereign, and almost every
king or queen adopted new ones. From these, and
from the royal badges, came many of the curious names
which may be found in old lists of ships. Such as
the &quot;Antelope,&quot; which refers to one of the supporters of
Henry VI.; the &quot;Bull&quot; of Edward IV.; the &quot;Dragon&quot;
of Henry VIII. and of Elizabeth. So also the badges:
the &quot;Sun,&quot; &quot;Rose in the Sun,&quot; and &quot;Falcon in the Fetterlock,&quot;
were all worn by Edward IV. The &quot;Double
Rose&quot; speaks for itself, and the &quot;Hawthorn&quot; belonged to
Henry VIII.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The supporters assumed by King James,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
and continued to all his successors, were a lion on the
dexter side, and on the sinister one of the Scottish unicorns&mdash;the
latter displacing the red dragon of the Tudor
family.</p>

<p class="indent">In ships the Royal Standard is never hoisted now
except when her Majesty is on board, or a member
of the royal family other than the Prince of Wales.
When the latter is on board his own standard is
hoisted. It is the same as that of the Queen, except
that it bears a label argent of three points, with the
arms of Saxony on an escutcheon of pretence. The
standard of the Duke of Edinburgh is the same as that
of the Prince of Wales, except that the points of the label
are charged, the first and third with a blue anchor, and
the second with the St. George's cross. Wherever the
sovereign is residing the Royal Standard is hoisted; and
on royal anniversaries and state occasions it is hoisted
at certain fortresses or stations&mdash;home and foreign&mdash;specified
in the Queen's Regulations.</p>

<h2><a name="x06" id="x06"></a>STANDARDS BORNE BY NOBLES.</h2>

<p class="indent">Standards borne by subjects were, in early times,
according to the Tudor MS. to be &quot;slitt at the end,&quot;
but they appear to have been also borne square. This
is the form in an old standard of Richard, Earl of Warwick&mdash;circa
1437&mdash;bearing his badge of the bear and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
ragged staff (Fig. 20). Shakespeare<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> alludes to this device
when he puts into the mouth of Warwick the words&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">But Shakespeare was out in his heraldry here, first in
confounding the badge with a crest, and secondly in calling
it Neville's, for the bear and the ragged staff had
been the badge not of the
Nevilles but of the Beauchamps,
who preceded Warwick
in the earldom.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> This
old Earl of Warwick had a
similar device on the flag which
he flew in his ship. It was a
long flag, having the cross of
St. George on the upper part&mdash;then
the bear and ragged
staff, and the remainder covered
with ragged staffs. It is
interesting to note that the
account for this and other flags made for the earl in 1437,
is preserved. The one just referred to is described as &quot;a
great Stremour for the ship of xi yerdis length and viij

In the Advocates' Library there is preserved an interesting
flag, which is said to have been the standard borne
by the Earl Marshall at the battle of Flodden (Fig. 21).
It is thus described in the paper which accompanies it:
&quot;The standard of the Earl Marshall of Scotland, carried
at the battle of Flodden, 1513, by <i>black</i> John Skirving of
Plewland Hill, his standard-bearer. Skirving was taken
prisoner, having previously, however, concealed the banner
about his person. The relic was handed down in the
Skirving family, and presented to the Faculty of Advocates
by William Skirving of Edinburgh, in the beginning
of the present century. The arms and motto are those
of the Keith family.&quot;</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 21.&mdash;Flag of the Earl Marshall.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The flag may have been borne by the earl at Flodden,
but the devices on it are certainly not his <i>arms</i>. The
arms of the Earl Marshall were, argent, on a chief gules
three pallets or; or, as it is otherwise given by Nisbet,
pallé of six, or and gules. The <i>crest</i> of the earl, however,
was a hart's head, and he had for supporters two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
harts. His motto also was that which appears on the
banner, &quot;Veritas vincit.&quot; That the full arms should
not appear on the standard I can understand, for it
was not common to place them there, and in England
the Tudor MS. prescribes that, besides the cross of
St. George, standards and guidons are to have on them
not the arms, but only the bearers &quot;<i>beast</i> or crest, with
his devyce and word.&quot; It is possible, therefore, that the
earl may have placed on his flag his well-known crest
with the heads of the two harts forming his supporters,
though such an arrangement would be unusual.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 22.&mdash;Standard of Earl Douglas, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1388.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The relic of a still older fight than that of Flodden is
still preserved in Scotland in the standard borne by Earl
Douglas at Otterburn&mdash;one of the most chivalrous battles,
according to Froissart, that was ever fought. The story,
as told in all the histories,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is that shortly before the battle,
in a skirmish before Newcastle, Douglas, in a personal
encounter with Percy, won the pennon of the English
leader, and boasted that he would carry it to Scotland
and plant it on his castle of Dalkeith; and till lately this
standard was supposed to be the flag so captured. But
recent investigation has shown that the flag&mdash;which, by
the way, is not a pennon but a standard thirteen feet
long&mdash;is that of Douglas himself, which of course his son
would be careful to preserve and bring back. The flag
is now much faded, and the second word of the motto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
was, when I saw it lately, not legible, but the motto
is undoubtedly that of Earl
Douglas, &quot;Jamais arriere&quot;
(Fig. 22). The devices are
not the arms as borne by his
descendants the Dukes of
Douglas;&mdash;indeed they are
not arranged as a coat of
arms at all. But the lion
rampant for Galloway, the
saltire for the lordship of
Annandale, and the heart and
the star, are all Douglas bearings.
Curiously enough, there
are two hearts, while the later
earls bore only one, and there
is only one star, while on their
shields they carried three.
The real trophies, the capture
of which, in all probability,
precipitated the battle,
are to be found in two other
relics which are preserved
along with the flag. They
consist of two lady's gauntlets,
fringed with filigree work
in silver, on each of which is embroidered the white lion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
of the Percys. The gloves are of different sizes, and were
perhaps love pledges, carried by Percy suspended from
his spear or helmet, as was the fashion of the time; and
the loss of such tokens was quite as likely as the loss of a
personal flag, to cause the Northumbrian knight to pursue
Douglas and force him to battle.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> These relics are in
the possession of the family of Douglas of Cavers in
Roxburghshire, descended
from the earl
who was slain at Otterburn.</p>

<h2>FLAGS BORNE BY TRADES.</h2>

<p class="indent">Besides national and personal flags, those of Trades
and Companies were frequently carried in armies, and of
these many examples occur in the illuminated copies of
Froissart. On one occasion we find on a banner azure a
chevron between a hammer, trowel, and plumb. On another
there is an axe and two pairs of compasses. And on
the painting of the battle between Philip d'Artevel and
the Flemings, and the King of France, banners occur
charged with boots and shoes, drinking vessels, &amp;c. In
Scotland an interesting example is preserved of a Trades
flag which was borne at Flodden, and which was presented
in 1482 by James III. to the Trades of Edinburgh
(Fig. 24). It is familiarly known as the <i>Blue Blanket</i>, and
is in the possession of the Trades' Maidens' Hospital of
Edinburgh. In an accompanying memorandum it is
described thus: &quot;The Blue Blanket or standard of the
Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh. Renewed by Margaret,
Queen of James III., King of Scots: Borne by the
craftsmen at the battle of Flodden in 1513, and displayed
on subsequent occasions when the liberties of the city or
the life of the sovereign were in danger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The field of the flag has been blue, but it is now much
faded. In the upper corner is the white saltire of Scotland,
with the crown above and the thistle in base. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
a scroll in the upper part of the flag are the words, &quot;Fear
God and Honor the king with a long life and a prosperous
reigne;&quot; and, in a scroll below, the words, &quot;And we
that is Tradds shall ever pray to be faithfull for the
defence of his sacred Majestes royal persone till death.&quot;
The flag is about ten feet in length.</p>

<h2><a name="x07" id="x07"></a>FLAGS OF THE COVENANTERS.</h2>

<p class="indent">Of the flags borne in Scotland by the Covenanters, in
their noble struggle for liberty, several are extant, and connected
as they are with so important a part of Scottish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
national history, they are replete with interest. One of
these, which is preserved by the Antiquarian Society of
Edinburgh, bears the national cross, the white saltire of
Scotland, with five roses in the centre point, and the inscription
&quot;For religion, Covenants, king, and kingdomes&quot;
(Fig. 25).</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 25.&mdash;Flag of the Covenanters, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1679.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">For the description of another of these flags of the
Covenanters, to which a more than usual interest attaches,
we are indebted to the late distinguished artist and archæologist
Mr. James Drummond, R.S.A.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Mr. Drummond
says it was known as &quot;the Bluidy Banner,&quot; and it is important
as confirming a statement which had been disputed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
namely, that Hamilton of Preston, who commanded
the Covenanters at the battle of Bothwell Brig, gave out
&quot;No quarter&quot; as the word of the day. Hamilton himself,
in his &quot;Vindication,&quot; not only acknowledges this, but
boasts of it&mdash;&quot;blessing God for it,&quot; he says, and &quot;desiring
to bless his holy name that since he helped me to set
my face to his work, I never had nor would take a favour
from mine enemies, either on the right or left hand, and
desire to give as few.&quot; But Wodrow denies the statement&mdash;characterizing
it as an unjust imputation on the
Covenanters, and in this he is followed by Dr. M'Crie.
The discovery of the flag, however, puts the matter
beyond doubt. Mr. Drummond found it in the possession
of an old gentleman and his sister in East Lothian,
and it was only after much persuasion that he was allowed
to see it and take a drawing of it. On his asking the
old lady why she objected to show it to strangers, she
said: &quot;It's the Bluidy Banner, ye ken, and what would
the Roman Catholics say if they kenned that our forbears
had fought under such a bluidy banner.&quot; By Roman
Catholics Mr. Drummond understood her to include
Episcopalians and all others of a different religious persuasion
from her own. The flag is of blue silk. The first
line of the inscription, which is composed of gilt letters, is in
the Hebrew language&mdash;&quot;Jehovah Nissi&quot;&mdash;the Lord is my
banner. The next line is painted in white&mdash;&quot;For Christ
and his truths;&quot; and then come the words, in a reddish or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
blood colour, &quot;No quarters for y<sup>e</sup> active enimies of y<sup>e</sup>
Covenant.&quot; The detailed account given by the custodiers
to Mr. Drummond, left no doubt as to the authenticity of
this flag. (See Plate II.)</p>

<h2><a name="x08" id="x08"></a>NATIONAL FLAGS.</h2>

<p class="indent">But I must proceed to speak of our national flags. For
a long time the distinguishing flag of England has been
a red cross on a white field. The flag of Scotland is a
white saltire (or St. Andrew's cross) on a blue field, and
what has come to be called the flag of Ireland is a red
saltire on a white field. But Ireland, strictly speaking,
never had till lately a national flag. The kings of Ireland
previous to 1172 were not hereditary but elective. They
were chosen from among the petty kings, and each king,
when elected, brought with him and continued to use his
own standard. After the invasion of 1172 the standard of
Ireland bore three golden crowns on a blue field, and the
three crowns appear on ancient Irish coins. Henry VIII.
relinquished this device for the harp, from an apprehension,
it is said, that the three crowns might be taken for
the triple crown of the pope; but the harp did not appear
in the royal standard till it was placed there by James I.
Neither had St. Patrick a cross. The cross-saltire, so far
as it belongs to any saint, is sacred to St. Andrew only.
The origin of the Scottish saltire, however, may possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
be found in the sacred monogram&mdash;the Greek X (CH),
the initial letter of our Lord's name as borne by the
Emperor Constantine, to which I have already referred.
I do not know when the Irish saltire was first introduced,
as a national flag, but from the early conquest of Ireland
the Fitzgeralds have borne as their arms a red saltire on
a white field.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<h2><a name="x09" id="x09"></a>THE UNION FLAG.</h2>

<p class="indent">In 1603, on the union of the <i>crowns</i> of England and
Scotland, the first union flag was formed by the combination
of St. George's cross with the saltire of Scotland;
but this flag appears to have been used for ships
only. The order by the king for its construction and use
bears to have been made &quot;in consequence of certain
differences between his subjects of North and South Britain
anent the bearing of their flags;&quot; and in the proclamation
issued in 1606, King James appoints that
&quot;from henceforth all our subjects of this Isle and Kingdom
of Great Britain shall bear in the maintop the red
cross commonly called St. George's Cross, and the white
cross commonly called St. Andrew's Cross, joined together
according to a form made by our heralds, and sent by
us to our admiral to be published to our said subjects.&quot;
This was the first union flag. The Scots being, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
sensitively jealous of England, insisted on using their own
national flag as well as the union, and it was no doubt
owing to this that the proclamation goes on to provide
that &quot;in their foretop our subjects of South Britain shall
wear the red cross only as they were wont, and our subjects
of North Britain in their foretop the white cross
only, as they were accustomed.&quot; In the ensign the union
was not worn till a considerable time afterwards&mdash;the
union by itself being then as now worn by the king's
ships as a jack at the bowsprit.</p>

<p class="indent">On the death of Charles I. the Commonwealth Parliament,
professing to be the Parliament of England only,
and of Ireland as a dependency, expunged the Scottish
cross from the flag with its blue field. The flag of command
ordered to take the place of the union, and to be
borne by the admirals of the respective squadrons, at
the main, fore, and mizen, is described<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> as &quot;the arms of
England and Ireland in two escutcheons on a red flag
within a compartment or,&quot;&mdash;that of the admiral, according
to Mr. Pepys, being encircled by a laurel wreath, while
those of the vice and rear-admirals were plain. The
ensigns showed the Irish harp on the fly.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="indent">On the Restoration in 1660 the union flag was reintroduced,
and when England and Scotland became
constitutionally united in 1707, this was confirmed, with
an order that it should be used &quot;in all flags, banners,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
standards, and ensigns, <i>both at sea and land</i>.&quot; The order
in council bears &quot;that the flaggs be according to the
draft marked C, wherein the crosses of St. George and
St. Andrew are conjoined;&quot; but none of the drafts appear
in the Register. A representation of this flag will be
found in Plate III. No. <span class="smcap">I.</span>, and there being no draft to
copy, I have given it according to the verbal blazon, viz.
azure a saltire argent surmounted by a cross gules fimbriated
of the second&mdash;that is, the St. George's cross with
a narrow white border.</p>

<p class="indent">On the union with Ireland in the beginning of the
present century the Irish saltire was introduced. The
St. George's cross remained as it was, but the saltires of
Scotland and Ireland were placed side by side, but &quot;counterchanged&quot;&mdash;that
is, in the first and third divisions or
quarters, the white, as senior, is uppermost, and in the
second and fourth the red is uppermost. The &quot;verbal
blazon,&quot; or written direction, is very distinct, but in
making the flag, or rather in showing pictorially how it
was to be represented, a singular and very absurd error
occurred, which, in the manufacture of our flags, has been
continued to the present day, and which it may be interesting
to explain.</p>

<p class="indent">The verbal blazon is contained in the minute by the
king in council, and in the proclamation which followed
on it, issued on 1st of January, 1801. I need not give
the technical words; suffice to say that the flag is appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
to be blue, with the three crosses, or rather, the one
cross and two saltires combined. And, in order to meet
a law in heraldry, that colour is not to be placed on colour,
or metal upon metal, it is directed that where the red
crosses of England and Ireland come in contact with the
blue ground of the flag, they are to be &quot;fimbriated&quot;&mdash;that
is, separated from the blue by a very narrow border
of one of the metals&mdash;in this case silver, or white. Of
heraldic necessity this border of both the red crosses fell
to be of the same breadth. To use the words of the
written blazon, the St. George's cross is to be &quot;fimbriated
<i>as the saltire</i>;&quot; a direction so plain that the merest tyro
in heraldry could not fail to understand it, and be able to
paint the flag accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Let me premise another thing. It is a universal rule
in heraldry that the verbal blazon, when such exists, is
alone of authority. Different artists may, from ignorance
or from carelessness, express the drawing differently from
the directions before them, and this occurs every day; but
no one is or can be misled by that if he has the verbal
blazon to refer to.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, in the important case of the Union flag it so
happened that the artist who, according to the practice
usual in such cases, was instructed to make a drawing of
the flag on the margin of the king's order in council,
was either careless or ignorant or stupid. Most probably
he was all three, and here is how he depicted it. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
horizontal lines represent blue and the perpendicular red;
the rest is white. (See Fig. 26.)</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 26.&mdash;Union Flag as depicted <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1801.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Now here, it will be observed, the red saltire of Ireland
is &quot;fimbriated&quot; white, according to the instructions; and
this is done with perfect accuracy, by the narrowest possible
border. But the St. George's cross, instead of
being fimbriated in the same way&mdash;which the written
blazon expressly says it shall be&mdash;is not fimbriated at all.
The cross is placed upon a ground of white so broad that
it ceases to be a border. The practical effect of this, and
its only heraldic meaning, is, that the centre of the flag,
instead of being occupied solely by the St. George's cross,
is occupied by <i>two crosses</i>, a white cross with a red one
superinduced on it. So palpable is this that Mr. Laughton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
the accomplished lecturer on naval history at the Royal
Naval College, in a lecture recently published, suggests
that this is perhaps what was really intended. &quot;A
fimbriation,&quot; he says, &quot;is a narrow border to prevent the
unpleasing effect of metal on metal or colour on colour.
It should be as narrow as possible to mark the contrast.
But the white border of our St. George's cross is not,
strictly speaking, a fimbriation at all. It is a white cross
of one-third the width of the flag surmounted of a red
cross.&quot; And his hypothesis is that this may have been
intended to commemorate a tradition of the combination
of the red cross of England with the white cross of France.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The suggestion is ingenious and interesting, but it has
clearly no foundation. There might have been something
to say for it had there been only the drawing to guide us.
In that case, indeed, the theory of Mr. Laughton, or
some one similar, would be absolutely necessary to account
for the two crosses. But Mr. Laughton overlooks the
important facts, first, that we possess in the verbal blazon
distinct written instructions; secondly, that where such
exist no drawing which is at variance with them can
possess any authority; and lastly, that in this case the
verbal blazon not only is silent as to a second cross, but
it expressly prescribes that there shall be only one, that
of St. George. To that nothing is to be added&mdash;nothing,
that is, but the narrow border or fimbriation necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
meet the heraldic requirement to separate it from the
blue ground of the flag, the same as is directed to be
done, and as has been done, with the saltire of Ireland.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Some years ago I called the attention of the Admiralty
to this extraordinary blunder, and I pointed out then, just
what Mr. Laughton has done in his recent lecture, that
the flag, as made, really shows two crosses in the centre.
The Admiralty referred the matter to Garter King of
Arms, but Sir Albert Woods, while he did not say a word
in defence of the arrangement, would not interfere. &quot;The
flag,&quot; he said, &quot;was made according to the drawing,&quot;&mdash;which
was too true&mdash;&quot;and it was exhibited,&quot; he added,
&quot;in the same way on the colours of the Queen's infantry
regiments;&quot; and, naturally enough, he declined the responsibility
of advising a change. And so it remains.
I may observe, however, that in one, at least, of the
Horse Guards' patterns, the arrangement of the tinctures
is not, as Sir Albert supposes, according to the original
drawing, and it is different from the pattern prescribed by
the Admiralty. I refer to the flag prescribed for the use
of military authorities &quot;when embarked in boats or other
vessels.&quot; In that flag, of which an official copy is now
before me, the fimbriation of the Irish saltire is of much
greater breadth than it is in the Admiralty flag, while
that saltire itself is considerably reduced in breadth.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides the error in the border of the St. George's
cross, the breadth of the Irish saltire in all our flags, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
now manufactured, is less than that of the white cross
of Scotland, which is clearly wrong. For obvious reasons,
and according to the written blazon, they ought to be the
same. Indeed, all the three crosses ought to be of the
same breadth. So great, however, is the difference in
practice, that in the official Admiralty Directions for the
construction of a flag of given dimensions, while the St.
George's cross is appointed to be 18 inches in breadth,
that of St. Andrew is to be only 9 inches, and the Irish
cross only 6&mdash;this last being exactly the same as the
breadth appointed for the border of the cross of St.
George!</p>

<p class="indent">Figure <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Plate III. shows the flag as made according
to the erroneous pattern now in use. Figure <span class="smcap">III.</span> shows it
as it ought to be, and as it is appointed to be made by
the distinct terms of the verbal blazon, in the order by
the king in council. But the breadth of the St. George's
cross I have left unaltered.</p>

<p class="indent">It is to be hoped that heraldic propriety will prevail
over a practice originating in obvious error, and that our
national flag will be flown according to its true blazon.
The correction would be very easily made. The reduction
of the breadth of the border of St. George's cross
and the slight increase in the width of the Irish saltire
would be little noticed, while, besides correcting obvious
errors, it would have the advantage of bringing the flag,
in one important respect, into conformity with the design
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
as represented on the coinage. On the reverse of our
beautiful bronze coins the St. George's cross on Britannia's
shield is fimbriated as it ought to be, that is, by the
narrow border prescribed by the written blazon.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">But if the penny is right in that respect, it exhibits
another extraordinary example of our slipshod heraldry,
by a variation of a different and more startling kind. My
complaint against the flag, as made, is, that it represents
four crosses, but on the penny there are only two. This
was all right when the design was first made in the reign
of Charles II., but when the third cross was added to the
flag the three crosses should have appeared on the coin. A
desire to adhere to the original design cannot certainly be
pleaded, for there have been many changes in this figure
of Britannia. She was first placed there by Charles II.
in honour of the beautiful Duchess of Richmond, who sat
to the sculptor for the figure. But her drapery on the
coin of those days was very scanty, and her semi-nude
state was hardly in keeping with the stormy waves beside
which she was seated. Queen Anne, like a modest lady
as she was, put decent clothing on her, and made her
stand upright, and took away her shield, crosses and all.
In the subsequent reigns she was allowed to sit down
again, and she got back her shield, with the trident in her
left hand and an olive-branch in the right. On the present
coinage&mdash;a copy of which (the penny) is shown in
Fig. 27&mdash;the drapery of Queen Anne is retained, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
figure is entirely turned round, and faces the sinister side
of the coin, instead of the dexter, as at first, and the olive-branch
(<i>absit omen</i>) has been taken
away. But with all these changes
there remain only two crosses on the
shield. The reader will naturally
suppose, however, that the omission
consisted in not adding the Irish
saltire to that of Scotland, which had
been there from the first. But no.
In this instance there was certainly no &quot;injustice to Ireland,&quot;
for the extraordinary thing is, that the St. Andrew's
cross has been taken away altogether, and the saltire of
Ireland, distinguished by its fimbriated border, has been
put in its place, Scotland being not now represented on
the coin at all. Of course this has arisen from mere carelessness
at the Mint, but it is an error which ought to be
at once corrected.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="x10" id="x10"></a>THE UNION JACK.</h2>

<p class="indent">But to return to our flags. The Union Jack is a
diminutive of the Union. It is exclusively a ship flag, and,
although of the same pattern as the Union, it ought never
to be called the Union <i>Jack</i> except when it is flown on
the jack-staff,&mdash;a staff on the bowsprit or fore part of a ship.
It is extraordinary how little this distinction is understood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
For example, in the Queen's Regulations for the army a
list of stations is given at which it is directed that &quot;the
national flag, <i>the Union Jack</i>, is authorized to be hoisted.&quot;
And in a general order issued from the North British
Head Quarters as to the arrangements to be observed on
a recent occasion of the sitting of the General Assembly in
Edinburgh, it was stated that &quot;the Union Jack&quot; would be
displayed from the Castle and at the Palace of Holyrood.
But the <i>Union Jack</i> is never flown on shore. The proper
name of the national flag is <i>the Union</i>. It is the shore
flag, and, except personal flags, the only one which is displayed
from fortresses and other stations.</p>

<p class="indent">At the Royal Arsenal and a few other stations the
Union flag is displayed daily. At others, such as Sandgate
Castle and Rye, it is flown only on anniversaries. At
Tilbury, Edinburgh Castle, and other places, it is hoisted
on Sundays and anniversaries. And there are similar
rules for foreign stations.</p>

<p class="indent">On board her Majesty's ships the Union is sometimes
displayed, but only on special occasions. It is
hoisted at the mizen top-gallant-masthead when the
Queen is on board, the Royal Standard and the flag
of the Lord High Admiral being at the same time
hoisted at the main and fore top-gallant-mastheads respectively.
And an Admiral of the Fleet hoists the
Union at the main top-gallant-masthead. The Army
Regulations, however, referring to the presence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
Queen on board ship, again confound the two flags, and
prescribe that a salute shall be fired by forts whenever
a ship passes showing the flags which indicate the
presence of the sovereign, and among these is specified
&quot;<i>the Union Jack</i> at the mizen top-gallant-masthead.&quot; If
the commandant of a fortress acted on this, her Majesty
might pass every day of the year without a salute, as he
would certainly never see the Union <i>Jack</i> in that position.
The mistake is the more curious as the Regulations
elsewhere distinguish the Union Jack from the Union by
speaking of the latter as the &quot;Great Union.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Jack when flown from the mast with a white
border is the signal for a pilot. In this case it is called
the Pilot Jack. When flown from the bowsprit of a
merchant ship it must also have a white border.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been said that the term &quot;Jack&quot; is derived from
the name of the sovereign James I. (<i>Jacques</i>), in whose
reign it was constructed. This is the legend at the
Admiralty, but it is of doubtful authority. The Oxford
Glossary says there is not a shadow of evidence for it,
and traces the word to the surcoat worn of old by the
soldiery called a <i>jacque</i>&mdash;whence jacket. But this also is
doubtful.</p>

<p class="indent">The Union, or junction of the three crosses, is used in
other cases in the royal navy, and also in the merchant
service, not by itself, but in certain combinations.</p>

<h2><a name="x11" id="x11"></a>THE ENSIGN.</h2>

<p class="indent">The flag under which all our ships now sail is the
Ensign.</p>

<p class="indent">In early times every chieftain or knight, whether
serving in the field or on board ship, had his own distinguishing
flag, and if several knights were embarked in
one ship, the ship carried the flags of them all. In one
of the illuminations of the reign of Henry VI., the sides
of a ship are covered with shields, and in other examples
armorial devices are even shown painted on the sails.
When engaged in any active service, a ship would carry
also the flag of the leader or admiral, and, in addition to this,
the emblem of some patron saint, depending in this on
the caprice or superstition of the owner. Besides these a
ship usually bore the flag of her port&mdash;a usage which, so
far as merchant ships are concerned, still holds among us
in the practice of carrying what are known as &quot;house
flags,&quot; though now strictly subordinated to that of carrying
the national ensign. With ships of other countries
the usage continued till comparatively lately. In France,
down to the Revolution, merchant ships flew the flag of
their port more commonly than the flag of France; as for
instance, of Marseilles, white with a blue cross; or of
Dunkirk, barry of six argent and azure, with the alternative
of the old English white ensign, white with a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
St. George's cross in the upper corner next the hoist,
derived from the English sovereignty in the seventeenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In the same way in the Baltic: in the Netherlands
almost every port had its own flag, and the free
towns of Germany till quite recently followed the same
practice. It was the same in England in early times&mdash;a
sailor being more a sailor of his port than of his country.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Now, as a rule, the ships of all countries sail under their
national colours. With us the flag under which all our
ships sail is the Ensign, of which there are three&mdash;the
white, the blue, and the red. It is a large flag of one of
the colours named, with the Union in a square or canton
at the upper part of the hoist. I may explain that the
portion of a flag next the staff or rope from which it is
flown is called the hoist, the next is called the centre,
and the outer portion the fly. Besides the Union in
the canton, the white ensign has the St. George's cross
extending over the whole field.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the Union flag of Great Britain was appointed
by royal order in 1606, it was not inserted in
the Ensign till 1707. Previous to that the Ensign bore
only the English cross in the canton.</p>

<p class="indent">In the royal navy, not always, but for some time
previous to 1864, the fleet consisted of three divisions
called the White, the Blue, and the Red Squadrons, each
carrying its distinctive Ensign, and, latterly, each having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
its admiral called after the colour of his flag. But till
1805 there was no admiral of the Red. Previous to that
the admiral commanding in the centre flew at the main,
not the red flag, but the Union.</p>

<p class="indent">The first notice of the division of the fleet appears in a
MS. report by Mr. Pepys, secretary to the Admiralty, in
which it is stated that in the Duke of Buckingham's expedition
against the Isle of Rhé in 1627 the fleet was thus
divided. The notice is interesting:&mdash;&quot;The Duke now lying
at Portsmouth divided his Fleete into squadrons. Himselfe,
Admirall and Generall in Chiefe, went in y<sup>e</sup> Triumph,
bearing the standard of England in y<sup>e</sup> maine topp, and
Admirall particular of the bloody colours. The Earle of
Lindsay was vice-Admirall to the Fleete in the Rainbowe,
bearing the king's usual colours in his fore topp, and a blew
flag in his maine topp, and was admiral of the blew colours.
The Lord Harvey was Rear Admirall in y<sup>e</sup> Repulse bearing
the king's usual colours in his mizen, and a white flag
in the maine topp, and was Admirall of y<sup>e</sup> squadron of
white colours.&quot; In this instance it will be observed the
blue flag took precedence of the white. Under the Commonwealth
the blue was put down to the third place, and
when on the Restoration the Union flag was reintroduced,
the precedence of the three colours remained as it had
been determined by the Commonwealth. The arrangement
of the fleet into three divisions continued till 1864; but it
often proved puzzling to foreigners, and it was found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
inconvenient in action. It was for this last reason that
Lord Nelson, on going into action at Trafalgar, ordered
the whole of his fleet to hoist the White Ensign, and
it was under that flag that that great victory was
gained.</p>

<p class="indent">During the wars of the seventeenth century the Dutch
fleets were also divided into three squadrons, distinguished,
like the English, by the three colours&mdash;orange or red,
white, and blue, and both with them and in our own service
this was perhaps necessary when fleets consisted of
such a large number of ships&mdash;our own numbering often
as many as 200 sail. Latterly, when fleets were comparatively
so much smaller, the distinctive colours became
of less importance, and in 1864 the classification was
discontinued. Now the White Ensign only is used by
all her Majesty's ships in commission. Previous to this
it had been ordered by royal proclamation, in 1801, that
merchant ships should fly only the Red Ensign, and this
is still the rule; but since the three divisions of the fleet
were abolished, the Blue Ensign is allowed to be used by
British merchant ships when commanded by officers of
the Royal Naval Reserve, provided one-third of the crew
be men belonging to the Reserve. By permission of the
Admiralty the Blue Ensign is also allowed to be used by
certain yacht clubs; and the members of one club&mdash;the
Royal Yacht Squadron&mdash;have liberty to use the White
Ensign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span></p>

<h2><a name="x12" id="x12"></a>SPECIAL FLAGS.</h2>

<p class="indent">The flag of the Lord High Admiral is crimson, having
on it an anchor and cable, and it is hoisted on any ship of
which that high officer is on board. It is also hoisted at
the fore top-gallant-masthead of every ship of which the
Queen may be on board. The flag of an admiral is white
with the cross of St. George on it. It is only flown by an
admiral when employed afloat, and then at the main, fore,
or mizen top-gallantmast-head, according as he is a full,
vice, or rear admiral.</p>

<p class="indent">The Union flag and the Blue Ensign are, with the addition
of certain distinctive badges, used as personal flags by
certain high officers, and also in particular departments
of the service. For example, the flag of the Lord-lieutenant
of Ireland is the Union with a blue shield in the
centre, charged with a golden harp. The Governor-general
of India has the Union with the Star of India in
the centre surmounted by a crown, and this also is the flag
of British Burmah. British ministers, chargés d'affaires,
fly the Union with the royal arms in the centre within a
circle argent surrounded by a wreath. Our consuls have
the Blue Ensign with the royal arms in the fly. There
are also differences in the Union or Ensign with distinctive
badges for other offices and departments, and for the
Colonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span></p>

<h2><a name="x13" id="x13"></a>THE PENDANT.</h2>

<p class="indent">The Pendant is a well-known flag in ships of war. It
is of two kinds, the long and the broad. The first is a
long, narrow, tapering flag&mdash;the usual length being twenty
yards, while it is only four inches broad at the head. An
Admiralty Memorandum regarding the history of our
flags bears that the origin of the long Pendant is generally
understood to have been this:&mdash;After the defeat of the
English fleet under Blake, by the Dutch fleet under Van
Tromp, in 1652, the latter cruised in the Channel with a
broom at the mast-head of his ship, to signify that he had
swept his enemies off the sea. In the following year the
English fleet defeated the Dutch, whereupon the admiral
commanding hoisted a long streamer from his mast-head
to represent the lash of a whip, signifying that he had
whipped his enemies off the sea. Hence the Pendant,
which has been flown ever since. This certainly has been
the popular tradition, and the English admiral may, on
the occasion referred to, have adopted a flag of the
description and for the purpose mentioned, but it was not
altogether a new form of flag. In the Tudor MS. we
find a description of a long tapering flag of somewhat
the same description. It is called a Streamer, and is
appointed to &quot;stand in the top of a ship or in the forecastle,
and therein is to be put no armes but a man's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
conceit or device, and may be of length 20, 30, 40, or 60
yards, and is slitt as well as a guydhomme or standard.&quot;
From this description the streamer would appear to have
been a personal flag bearing &quot;the conceit or device&quot;&mdash;crest,
badge, or motto&mdash;of the owner.</p>

<p class="indent">As now used in our navy the long pendant is of two
colours&mdash;one white with a red cross in the part next the
mast; the other blue with a red cross on a white ground.
The first is flown from the mast-head of all her Majesty's
ships in commission, when not otherwise distinguished by
a flag or broad pendant. The other is worn at the masthead
of all armed vessels in the employ of the government
of a British colony. (See Plate III. No. <span class="smcap">IV.</span>)</p>

<p class="indent">The broad pendant or &quot;burgee&quot; is a flag tapering
slightly and of a swallow-tailed shape at the fly. It is
white with a red St. George's cross, and is flown only by
a commodore, or the senior officer of a squadron, to distinguish
his ship. If used by a commodore of the first
class it is flown at the main top-gallant-masthead. Otherwise
it is flown at the top-gallant-masthead.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="x14" id="x14"></a>SIGNALS AND OTHER FLAGS.</h2>

<p class="indent">Signal flags are those which are used for communication
between ships at sea. In the system instituted by James II.
intelligence was communicated or messages interchanged
by a confused number of flags exhibited at different parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
of the ship. Now, signalling has been reduced to a complete
system. The flags are of various shapes and colours,
each flag representing a letter or number, and by a recent
arrangement a universal code has been adopted by which
vessels of different nations can now communicate.</p>

<p class="indent">A flag of truce is white, both at sea and on land, but on
board ship it is customary to hoist with it the national
flag of the enemy&mdash;the white flag at the main and the
enemy's ensign at the fore. On one occasion during the
war in 1814 when the French frigate <i>Clorinde</i> was about
to be attacked by the British frigate <i>Dryad</i>, the commander
of the former, being desirous to ascertain what
terms would be granted in case he surrendered, hoisted
French colours aft and English colours forward. Under
cover of this the French frigate sent a boat with the
message. The answer was a refusal to grant any terms,
but the boat was allowed to return to the French frigate
in safety before the <i>Dryad</i> filled and stood towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">The Ensign and Pendant at half-mast are the recognised
signs of mourning. Sometimes also it is an
expression of mourning to set the yards at what seamen
call &quot;a-cock-bill,&quot; that is all the yards topped up different
ways on each mast; but this is chiefly done by foreigners,
who, on Good Friday and other occasions, set their yards
thus. It is also customary as a sign of mourning to paint
the white lines of a ship of a blue colour. In older times,
when ships were more gaudily painted and gilded than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
they are now, they were painted black all over as a sign
of mourning.</p>

<p class="indent">The red or bloody flag is a signal of mutiny, and as
such it was displayed in our own navy on two noted
occasions in the end of last century, when the fleet at
Spithead mutinied, and afterwards that at the Nore. In
the latter case the mutineers hauled down the flag of
Vice-admiral Buckner and in its stead hoisted the red
flag. It is a singular fact, however, and characteristic of
the British seaman, that on the 4th of June, the king's
birth-day, while the mutiny was at its height, the whole
fleet, with the exception of one ship, evinced its loyalty
by firing a royal salute, and displaying the colours usual
on such occasions, the red flag being struck during the
ceremony, and only re-hoisted when it was over.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<h2><a name="x15" id="x15"></a>USE OF FLAGS IN NAVAL WARFARE.</h2>

<p class="indent">Such are the principal naval flags. Of the circumstances
in which they may or may not be legitimately used,
especially in naval warfare, some interesting stories might
be told.</p>

<p class="indent">Although it is prohibited to merchant ships to carry
the colours used in the navy, this may be done in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
time of war to deceive an enemy. I may mention one
instance when it was practised with happy effect. In the
French war in 1797 the French Rear-admiral Sarcy, when
cruising with six frigates in the Bay of Bali, came in sight
of five of our Indiamen&mdash;one of them, the <i>Woodford</i>,
Captain Lennox. They were homeward bound, and all
richly laden, and to all appearance they had no chance of
escape, when Captain Lennox rescued them by an act of
great judgment and presence of mind. He first of all
hoisted in his own ship a flag which the French admiral
knew well&mdash;that of the British Admiral Rainier, blue at
the mizen, and he made all the other ships in his company
hoist pendants and ensigns to correspond. But he did
more. He detached two of the Indiamen to chase and
reconnoitre the enemy; and as these advanced towards
the French reconnoitring frigate the <i>Cybèle</i>, the latter,
completely deceived, made all sail to join her consorts
with the signal at her mast-head&mdash;&quot;The enemy is superior
in force to the French.&quot; On this the French admiral,
believing that he was in the presence of a powerful British
squadron, made off with his frigates under all sail, and
Captain Lennox and his consorts completed their voyage
in safety. When Admiral Sarcy discovered afterwards
the ruse that had been practised on him, and which had
lost him a prize of such great value, his mortification
may be imagined.</p>

<p class="indent">In going into action it is the custom with the ships of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
all nations to hoist their national colours. Nelson at
Trafalgar carried this to excess, for he hoisted several
flags lest one should be shot away. The French and
Spaniards went to the opposite extreme, for they hoisted
no colours at all, till late in the action, when they began
to feel the necessity of having them to strike.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Nelson
on that occasion ran his ship on board the <i>Redoubtable</i>, a
large seventy-four gun ship, and fought her at such close
quarters that the two ships touched each other. Twice
Nelson gave orders to cease firing at his opponent, supposing
she had surrendered, because her great guns were
silent, and as she carried no flag there was no means of
instantly ascertaining the fact. It was from the ship
which he had thus twice spared that Nelson received his
death wound. The ball was fired from the mizen-top,
which, so close were the ships, was not more than fifteen
yards from the place where he was standing. Soon
afterwards the <i>Redoubtable</i>, finding further resistance
impossible, hoisted her flag, only to haul it down again
in sign of surrender, within twenty minutes after the fatal
shot had been fired. In this great battle each of the
Spanish ships had in addition to her ensign a large wooden
cross hung to the end of her spanker boom.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">When a ship surrenders the fact is usually intimated
by her hauling down her flag, but in Lord Cochrane's
spirited attack on the French fleet in Basque Roads in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
1809, two of the French ships, the <i>Varsovie</i> and <i>Aquilon</i>,
made the token of submission by each showing a Union
Jack in her mizen chains; and in other instances during
the war French ships hoisted a Union Jack as the signal
of their having struck.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course when a ship has surrendered the fire of both
ships ceases. In an action off Lissa between British ships
and a Franco-Venetian squadron, the French ship <i>Flore</i>
surrendered to the British frigate <i>Amphion</i>. Immediately
afterwards the Venetian frigate <i>Bellona</i> bore up and commenced
a heavy fire against the <i>Amphion</i>, and some of
the shot struck the captured ship on the other side. Supposing,
erroneously, that the shot came from the British
ship, one of the officers of the <i>Flore</i>, in order to make
more clear the fact of her having absolutely surrendered,
took the French ensign, halliards and all, and holding them
up in his hand over the taffrail to attract the attention
of the <i>Amphion's</i> people, threw the whole into the sea.
Having captured the <i>Bellona</i> also, the captain of the
<i>Amphion</i> temporarily left the surrendered ship while he
pursued another of the enemy, the <i>Corona</i>, which he also
captured. When thus engaged, however, he was mortified
to see his first prize, the <i>Flore</i>, notwithstanding her emphatic
act of submission, dishonourably stealing away, and
she actually effected her escape into the harbour of Lessina.
Captain Hoste, who commanded the British squadron,
afterwards sent a letter by a flag of truce to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
captain of the <i>Flore</i>, demanding restitution of the frigate
in the same state as when she struck her flag and surrendered
to the <i>Amphion</i>; but the commander of the
French squadron replied by a letter, neither signed nor
dated, denying that the <i>Flore</i> had struck, and falsely
asserting that the colours had been shot away. The
letter was sent back and the demand repeated, but no
answer was returned.</p>

<p class="indent">I may mention another instance in which captured
colours were thrown into the sea in token of surrender
under different circumstances, but not more creditable to
the vanquished party. In the war between America and
the Barbary States in the early part of the century, the
United States schooner <i>Enterprise</i>, under the command
of Lieutenant Sterrett, fell in with and engaged a Tripolitan
polacre ship, and in the course of the action the
colours of the latter were either shot away or struck&mdash;in
all probability the latter, for the Americans believed she
had surrendered and quitted their guns. The Corsair,
however, re-hoisted her flag and continued the action.
Thereupon the <i>Enterprise</i> poured in so destructive a fire
that her opponent this time unequivocally hauled down
her colours, and Lieutenant Sterrett ordered her under
his lee quarter. This order was obeyed, but the Tripolitan,
when he got there, thinking his position favourable,
re-hoisted the red flag, and having poured another
broadside into the <i>Enterprise</i>, prepared to board. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
Americans, justly incensed at this treacherous act, delivered
a raking broadside which effectually terminated
the affair. The Tripolitan captain now abjectly implored
the quarter which he had justly forfeited, and bending
over the waist barricade of his ship, and as an indication
of his sincerity, raised his colours in his arms and threw
them into the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">In contrast to the conduct of the captain of the <i>Flore</i>
in carrying off his ship after he had surrendered, may be
mentioned the very different course taken by the officer
in command of a French 40-gun frigate, the <i>Renommée</i>,
which was captured off Madagascar in 1811, after an
action between a French squadron, and a British squadron
under Captain Schomberg. From the state of
the British ships after the action, Captain Schomberg,
when night was coming on, could only send on board
the prize a lieutenant of marines and four seamen, in
a sinking boat. At this time the <i>Renommée</i> had a
crew of nearly 400 effective officers and men, and they
could have had at once retaken the ship and got off
during the night. The crew wished to do so, but Colonel
Barrois, who&mdash;the captain having been killed&mdash;was now,
according to the etiquette of the French service, the commanding
officer, acting on a high principle of honour,
refused to give his sanction, as they had surrendered by
striking their flag. The lieutenant and his few hands
remained accordingly in quiet possession of the prize, till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
the prisoners were taken out next morning, and a proper
prize crew placed on board.</p>

<p class="indent">When an action takes place at night, when flags cannot
be seen, other modes of intimating surrender have to be
reverted to. In the war with America, in 1815, when a
British ship in a disabled state found she had no alternative
but to surrender at midnight to an American ship of
superior force, she did so by firing a lee gun and hoisting
a light. In another case a French frigate, the <i>Néréide</i>,
after a severe action during night with the British frigate
<i>Ph&oelig;be</i>, surrendered to the latter by hauling down a light
she had been carrying, and hailing that she surrendered.
In another case a French ship intimated the fact of her
surrender by hoisting a light and instantly hauling it
down.</p>

<p class="indent">When a ship has surrendered and is taken possession
of, the captor hoists his ensign over that of the enemy.
In one instance a mistake in this produced disastrous
results. In the celebrated capture of the <i>Chesapeake</i> off
Boston in 1813, when the American flag was struck, the
officer of the <i>Shannon</i> who was sent on board the <i>Chesapeake</i>
to take possession, inadvertently&mdash;owing to the
halliards being tangled&mdash;bent the English flag below the
American ensign instead of above it. By this time the
two ships were drifting apart, and when the <i>Shannon's</i>
people saw the American stripes going up first they concluded
that their boarding party had been overpowered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
and at once reopened their fire, by which their first-lieutenant
and several of their own men were killed.
The mistake was discovered before the flags had got halfway
to the mizen peak, when they were hauled down and
hoisted properly. In this brilliant but short action&mdash;for
between the discharge of the first gun and the conclusion of
the fight only fifteen minutes elapsed&mdash;the American ship,
by way of display, carried more than the ordinary number
of flags. She flew three ensigns, one at the mizen, one at
the peak, and one, the largest of all, in the starboard
main rigging. She had besides, flying at the fore, a large
white flag inscribed with the words &quot;Sailors' Rights and
Free Trade,&quot; with the intention, it was supposed, of
damping the energy of the <i>Shannon's</i> men by this favourite
American motto. The <i>Shannon</i> had the Union at the
fore and an old rusty blue ensign at the mizen peak, and
besides these she had one ensign on the main stay and
another in the main rigging, both rolled up and &quot;stopped&quot;
ready to be cast loose in case either of the other flags
should be shot away.</p>

<p class="indent">A similar display of flags occurred on the occasion of
the encounter off Valparaiso in 1814 between the British
36-gun frigate <i>Ph&oelig;be</i> and the United States 32-gun
frigate <i>Essex</i>, which resulted in the capture of the latter.
Captain Porter, who commanded the American ship,
made an attempt, as in the case of the <i>Chesapeake</i>, on the
loyalty of the <i>Ph&oelig;be's</i> seamen, by hoisting at his fore top-gallant-mast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
head the stock motto, &quot;Free Trade and
Sailors' Rights.&quot; This, in a short time, the British ship
answered with the St. George's ensign and the motto,
&quot;God and Country&mdash;British sailors' best rights: Traitors
offend them.&quot; Subsequently the <i>Essex</i> hoisted her
motto flag at the fore, and another on the mizen mast,
with one American ensign at the mizen peak and a
second lashed on the main rigging. Not to be outdone
in decorations the British ship hoisted her motto
flag with a profuse display of ensigns and union jacks,
and all these were flying when the American ship was
captured.</p>

<p class="indent">To hoist false colours in time of war in order to entice
an enemy within reach has always been considered
legitimate, but it is not allowable to engage, or to commit
any hostile act, under them. While it is considered
legitimate to mislead, however, it is not legitimate to
cheat. An example of what might appear to be a distinction
without a difference is afforded by a case which
occurred in 1783, when the French ship <i>Sybille</i>, a powerful
36-gun frigate, was sighted off Cape Henry by the
<i>Hussar</i> of 28 guns. The <i>Sybille</i> had, a few days before,
had a drawn fight with one of our ships of the same force,
and, in consequence of injuries she had then received, had
been dismasted in a puff of wind, and was under jury
masts. As she was unable to chase the <i>Hussar</i>, she
sought to entice her alongside, in order to take her by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
boarding, and accordingly she hoisted at the peak the
French ensign under the English, as if she had been captured.
All this was legitimate, and the <i>Hussar</i> might or
might not have been deceived by it. But the French
captain did something more. He hoisted in the main
shrouds an English ensign reversed, and tied in a weft or
loop. Now this was a well-known signal of distress&mdash;an
appeal to a common humanity, which no English officer
was ever known to disregard, and the <i>Hussar</i> closed at
once. But fortunately her crew were at quarters, and the
<i>Sybille</i>, hauling down the English flag at the peak and
hoisting the French above, endeavoured to run her on board.
Her extreme rolling, however, steadied by no sufficient
sail, exposed her bottom, and several shots from the
<i>Hussar</i> went through her very bilge. By this time
another of our ships, the <i>Centurion</i> of 50 guns, had come
up, and the <i>Sybille</i> struck her flag&mdash;the reversed ensign
with its weft, so dishonourably hoisted, remaining in the
main shrouds. The English officer who took possession
sent the French captain on board the <i>Hussar</i>, and he
presented his sword to Captain Russell on the quarterdeck.
Russell took the sword, broke it across, and threw
it on the deck; and sending the Frenchman below, kept
him in close confinement in the hold till his arrival in port
some days later.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p class="indent">I may mention another case where a legitimate ruse was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
successfully practised on an enemy by our great naval commander,
Lord Cochrane. It occurred in the early part of
his brilliant career, when he was cruising in the Mediterranean
in his little brig the <i>Speedy</i>. This small craft,
under her daring and skilful commander, had made herself
so much an object of terror by the many captures she had
made that a Spanish frigate, heavily armed, was fitted
out and sent after her. In order to get near the
<i>Speedy</i> the Spaniard was disguised as a merchantman.
For the same reason, Lord Cochrane, to lull suspicion
and enable him to get near the merchant craft of the
enemy, had also disguised his small vessel, and was
sailing as a merchant brig under Danish colours. Perceiving
the supposed Spanish merchantman, Lord Cochrane
at once gave chase, and he only discovered his
mistake when his formidable antagonist opened her ports
and showed her teeth. At the same time the Spaniard
lowered a boat to go on board the <i>Speedy</i> and see what
she was. Discovery and capture were apparently now
unavoidable, but Lord Cochrane was equal to the
occasion. Hoisting the yellow flag&mdash;the dreaded signal of
sickness and quarantine&mdash;he made straight for the frigate,
and, having dressed a petty officer in Danish uniform,
on the gangway, he ordered him to hail the boat with
the intimation that they were out just two days from
Algiers, where it was well known the plague was then
violently raging. This was enough. The boat pulled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
back, and the frigate at once filled and proceeded on her
course.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a narrow escape; yet the crew of the <i>Speedy</i>
complained loudly that they had not been allowed to fight
the frigate! They had been admirably trained, and had
implicit confidence in their brave commander, and thought
he was equal to anything. Lord Cochrane was not a
man to disregard murmurs uttered in such a direction,
and he told them that if they really wanted a fight they
would get it with the first enemy they came across, whatever
she might be. They had not long to wait before
they fell in with a large Spanish zebec, the <i>Gamo</i>, which,
to the astonishment of the big ship, Lord Cochrane immediately
attacked. A fight with the guns could not
have lasted long, for the Spanish ship carried 30 heavy
guns with a crew of upwards of 300 men, while the <i>Speedy</i>
had only 14 four-pounders and a crew of 54 all told. Lord
Cochrane, therefore, notwithstanding this immense disparity
of force, determined, as his only chance, to board the
frigate, and this he succeeded in doing, taking his entire
crew with him and leaving only the surgeon at the wheel.
A deadly hand-to-hand conflict ensued, when, just as his
small band were nearly overpowered, Lord Cochrane
ordered one of his men to haul down the Spanish colours.
This was promptly done, and the Spaniards&mdash;their commander
having been killed&mdash;thinking that their own
officers had struck, ceased fighting, and Lord Cochrane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
became master of the frigate. How to take care of his
numerous prisoners was not a small difficulty, but he
succeeded in doing so, and brought his prize safely into
Port Mahon. It was one of the most brilliant affairs in
the glorious life of this great seaman.</p>

<p class="indent">Another interesting example of an enemy's ship being
taken in consequence of her colours being hauled down, not
by her own officers but by the party assailing, occurred at a
much earlier period in an action between the British and
Dutch fleets off the English coast. A runaway boy&mdash;Thomas
Hopson&mdash;an apprentice to a tailor in the Isle of
Wight, had just before come on board the admiral's ship as a
volunteer. In the midst of the action he asked a sailor how
long the fight would continue, and was told that it would
only cease when the flag of the Dutch admiral was hauled
down. The boy did not understand about the striking of
colours, but he thought if the hauling down of the flag
would stop the fight it might not be difficult to do. As
the ships were engaged yard-arm and yard-arm, and veiled
in smoke, Hopson at once ran up the shrouds, laid out
on the mizen-yard of his own ship, and having gained
that of the Dutch admiral he speedily reached the top-gallant-mast
head and possessed himself of the Dutch flag,
with which he succeeded in returning to his own deck.
Perceiving the flag to be struck the British sailors raised
a shout of victory, and the Dutch crew, also deceived, ran
from their guns. While the astonished admiral and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
officers were trying in vain to rally their crew the English
boarded the ship and carried her. For this daring service
the boy was at once promoted to the quarter-deck,
and he rose to be a distinguished admiral under Queen
Anne.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="x16" id="x16"></a>INTERNATIONAL USAGE AS TO FLAGS.</h2>

<p class="indent">In time of peace it is considered an insult to hoist the
flag of one friendly nation over that of another. This has
given rise to an order that national flags are not to be
used for decoration or in dressing ships. This order has
reference more particularly to two flags, which are in
ordinary use as signal flags. One of these is the French
tricolour, but with the red and blue transposed; the other
is the Dutch flag turned upside down, and there are two
pendants to match. An unintentional departure from this
rule gave rise to some unpleasantness on one occasion in
the early part of this century. On the 23d of April, 1819,
the English frigate <i>Euryalus</i>, lying at St. Thomas in the
West Indies, had dressed ship in honour of St. George's
day&mdash;the fête of the Prince Regent&mdash;and in doing so had
made use of the blue, white, and red flag, which four years
before had been the national flag of France. A three-coloured
pennant hung down from the spanker boom and
trailed in the water, and another three-coloured flag was
at the lower end of the line pendant from the flying boom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
This was observed by the French Rear-admiral Duperré,
who was there in the <i>Gloire</i>, and he demanded and
received apologies for what he conceived to be an insult
offered to a flag which had lately been the flag of France,
and under which he and many of his officers and men had
served.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p class="indent">If a foreign flag is hoisted on shore&mdash;as it often is in
compliment to some distinguished stranger&mdash;it must have
the staff to itself. In 1851, when the queen of Louis
Philippe visited Oban, the proprietor of the Caledonian
Hotel, at which she resided, in compliment to his visitor,
and in ignorance, no doubt, of the proprieties of the case,
hoisted the French flag over the Union. This excited
the indignation of an old pensioner, John Campbell, who
had been a sergeant in the 71st Highlanders&mdash;the regiment
of Campbell of Lochnell&mdash;and he went to the innkeeper
and demanded that matters should be put right.
As no attention was paid to his remonstrance, he then and
there cut down the French flag, and dared the innkeeper
to hoist it again in that manner. The residents in Oban
were so pleased with Campbell's spirited conduct that
they presented him with a silver-headed stick.</p>

<p class="indent">In gun practice it is also held to be an insult to take as
a mark the flag of another nation, and sometimes unintentional
offence has been given through mistakes about
the flags in such circumstances. For the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
I am indebted to a distinguished naval officer who was
cognizant of the circumstances. Some twenty years
ago, when the French had an army of occupation in
Syria, and their fleet and ours were lying amicably
together at Beyrout, some of the English ships having
occasion to practise the men with their rifles, put out their
respective targets&mdash;which generally consisted of bits of
old flags fastened to a stick, and stuck in a small cask
anchored off at the required distance&mdash;and commenced
firing. Presently a boat with a superior officer was seen
pulling in hot haste from the French flagship. It afterwards
transpired that the boat was conveying a polite
request that the English would refrain from firing on the
French flag&mdash;the officer at the same time pointing to an
exceedingly dirty piece of bunting which was being riddled
by the bullets from one of her Majesty's ships. &quot;That's
not the French flag,&quot; was the answer of the English.
&quot;Yes, I assure you,&quot; the Frenchman replied, &quot;we are
nearer than you are, and can see the colours. And, pardon
me,&quot; he added, &quot;another of your ships is at the present
moment, in this Turkish port, firing on the Turkish flag&quot;&mdash;pointing
at the same time to another target, consisting
of a faded bit of red bunting. Inquiries were made, and
what had been taken for the Tricolour was found to be a
piece of an old condemned Union Jack, that had unfortunately
been nailed on to the staff without due regard to
the position of the colours, while the so-called Turkish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
flag was discovered to be a fragment of an old English
red ensign.</p>

<p class="indent">To the same naval officer I am indebted for the following
amusing incident, which I am glad to give in his own
words, as he was personally concerned in it. &quot;About the
same time,&quot; he writes, &quot;another occurrence of the same
kind took place at Larnaca, in Cyprus. It happily ended
well, but at one time it looked quite serious. One of our
surveying vessels had taken advantage of a lull in the
work to practise her crew with her formidable armament
of two twenty-four pounders, and on a bright calm Mediterranean
morning the gunner was sent for by the senior
lieutenant, and directed to prepare a target. But here
there arose a difficulty. The ship had been a long time
from Malta, stores of all kinds were scarce, and of old
bunting there was absolutely none. The gunner was in
despair, but a marine came to the rescue, and offered his
pocket-handkerchief as a substitute. It was about the
usual size of such articles, and as it had been bought at
Malta while disturbances were pending at Naples, it had
the Italian colours, green, white, and red, together with a
pendant, printed on it, and on the white part some patriotic
sentences in Italian. The whole presented an ancient
and faded appearance, but the gunner accepted it with
thanks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it was duly nailed on a staff stuck into a small cask,
and anchored about 600 yards to seaward. After the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
firing from the howitzers was finished the men were
ordered to fire on it with rifles, which for a time they did.
While this was going on a small French brig happened
to be lying in the roads, and during the forenoon a boat
was observed pulling from her in the direction of the
target, but it did not venture very close; the firing was
not suspended, and nothing further was thought about it.
Before going to dinner in the middle of the day, a boat
was sent to examine the target to see if it would float, as
it was intended to continue the practice in the afternoon,
and although it was reported to have been knocked about
a good deal, it was thought it might remain afloat as long
as it would be required, and so it was left. About an
hour afterwards, however, it disappeared, and went to the
bottom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The lieutenant, who had been weary with his work
and had gone to bed early, was much astonished at being
sent for by the captain about midnight. A formal despatch
from our consul had come on board, inclosing a communication
from the French representative giving a detailed
account of what was described as a gross insult to
the French flag, perpetrated by H.M.S. &mdash;&mdash;, and demanding
all kinds of apologies. The prime mover in
the affair, it appeared, was a certain captain Napoleon
something, the commander of the little brig. His story
was that he had seen with indignation the flag of his
country&mdash;in size six feet square by his account&mdash;carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
out by an English man-of-war boat, and deliberately fired
upon. He and his crew, he said, had got into their boat
determined to rescue the desecrated ensign, 'even at the
risk of their lives,' but on getting near they had thought
better of it, and pulled ashore instead. Here he had collected
all the French residents he could get, whom he
harangued, and having persuaded them that the scarcely
visible speck was in truth their national flag, he got them
to sign a strongly worded protest, and go with it along
with him in a body to the French consul. Reparation,
they said, must be made&mdash;the insulted flag must be
saluted. So great was the excitement and so plausible
the story that the French consul, pending negotiations,
sent to Beyrout requiring the immediate presence of a
French man-of-war. In fact there was all the groundwork
of a very pretty row. Meantime the cause of all
the commotion was lying at the bottom of the sea, with
five or six fathoms of water over it. A written explanation
of the circumstance was sent from the ship, and a
meeting arranged for next day at the English consulate;
and in the meantime a number of boats were sent
early in the morning to try and fish up the bone of contention,
as without it there was only the English word
against the French. At the consulate there was a stormy
meeting&mdash;much hard swearing and vociferation on the
part of the French captain and his crew, with the affidavits
of any number of respectable French residents, formally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
drawn up and signed. Everybody was getting very
angry, and prospect of an amicable settlement there was
none, when in a momentary lull the English lieutenant
asked the French captain&mdash;who had for the fiftieth time
declared that it <i>was</i> a French flag, and six feet square at
least&mdash;'whether it was likely that he knew more about it
than the marine who had blown his nose with it for the
last six months.' This in some measure restored good
humour. The meeting separated in a more friendly
spirit than had at first seemed possible, and when, on the
following day, a lucky cast of the grapnel brought to the
surface the innocent cause of the disturbance, there was
an end of the matter. Torn by bullets, draggled and wet
as it was, the wretched handkerchief was borne in triumph
to the French consulate, and of course there was no more
to be said. The consul made the proper <i>amende</i>, and the
man-of-war, which actually appeared from Beyrout a few
hours afterwards to vindicate the honour of the French
flag, returned to her anchorage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I shall just add one more incident of the same kind, for
which I am indebted to another naval officer. In 1879
an English corvette visited Tahiti. The island, being
under French protection, flies a special flag, and as it is
one which is not supplied to English men-of-war, it is
usual, when it is necessary for them to salute, to borrow a
protectorate flag from the authorities. On the occasion
in question, accordingly, the flag was sent off by the governor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
aide-de-camp (a naval officer) on the evening of
the corvette's arrival at Papeite, and the flag having been
hoisted on the following morning, the salute was duly
fired. But the display of the flag caused a terrible commotion
on shore. On such occasions the whole population
turns out to see the salute, and the beach of the
beautiful land-locked, or rather reef-inclosed, harbour was
crowded with French and Tahitians watching the corvette,
which was moored close under the town. The cause of
the commotion was that the flag had been improperly
made, so that in hoisting it the French ensign, by pure
inadvertence, appeared underneath that of Tahiti. The
indignation of the French was great, and they hastened
to complain to the governor that their flag had been
deliberately insulted by her Majesty's ship. The mistake,
fortunately, lay entirely with the authorities on shore. It
was only on hauling it down that the officer in command
found it had been caused by the flag being improperly
constructed, the technical explanation being that the distance
line had been sewed in, the wrong way, with the
taggle towards the bottom of the flag&mdash;a very trifling
thing in itself, but which, if unexplained, might have led
to serious consequences. Of course the flag was immediately
sent to the governor with the explanation, and
there was an end of it. So much for naval flags.</p>

<h2><a name="x17" id="x17"></a>FLAGS OF THE BRITISH ARMY.</h2>

<p class="indent">I have already noticed incidentally some of the flags
used in the armies of England in early times. Those
used in the latter part of the thirteenth century, and early
in the fourteenth, were, besides those of the knights and
bannerets, the Royal Standard and the banners of St.
George, of St. Edmund, and of St. Edward. Subsequently
various changes took place which it is unnecessary
to follow.</p>

<p class="indent">At present in the British army every regiment of infantry
has two flags. They are both made of silk, in this differing
from sea flags, which are usually made of bunting. With the
exception of the Foot Guards, the first or Queen's colours
of every regiment is the Union or National Flag, with
the imperial crown in the centre, and the number of the
regiment beneath in gold. The second or regimental
colours are, with certain exceptions, of the colour of the
facing of the regiment, with the Union in the upper
corner. The second colours of all regiments bear the
devices or badges and distinctions which have been conferred
by royal authority. Fig. 28 is a representation
of the regimental or second colours of the first battalion
of the 24th Regiment, for which I am indebted to the
courtesy of Sir Albert Woods. It will serve as an example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
of the regimental colours of other regiments. The pole,
it will be observed, is surmounted by the royal crest, and
this is common to all regiments carrying colours. The
ground of the flag is grass green. The crown and wreath
are &quot;proper,&quot; that is of the natural colours. The scrolls
are gold with black letters.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 28.&mdash;Regimental Colours of First Battalion of 24th Regiment.</p>

<p class="indent">The first or royal colours of the Foot Guards are crimson,
and bear certain special distinctions besides those
authorized for the second colours&mdash;the whole surmounted
by the imperial crown. The second, or regimental colours,
of the Foot Guards is the Union, with one of the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
badges conferred by royal authority. The first battalion
of the Scots Fusilier Guards possesses the high distinction
of carrying on their first colours the royal arms of
Scotland.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 29.&mdash;Queen's Colours of the First Battalion of 24th Regiment.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The colours of infantry are as a rule carried by the
two junior lieutenants, and our military annals present
many examples of devoted heroism by the standard-bearers
in defence of their charge. Among such incidents
few are more interesting than the loss and recovery of the
Queen's colours of the first battalion of the 24th Regiment
in the African campaign of 1878-79, to which I have already
referred. It will be recollected that Lieutenants Melville
and Coghill, after crossing the river Tugela with the Queen's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
colours, were overtaken and attacked by overwhelming
numbers and shot down. They died bravely, revolvers
in hand, but their pursuers failed to get possession of their
precious charge&mdash;the colours having been found near them
when the bodies were recovered. The Queen was much
affected by this incident, and bestowed on the young heroes
after death the highest distinction for valour in her power&mdash;the
Victoria cross. On the arrival of the colours in
England the Queen expressed a wish to see them, and they
were taken to Osborne, where her Majesty tied on them a
small wreath of immortelles as a mark of her deep sense
of the heroism of the two young officers who gave their
lives to save the flag. Fig. 29 shows the colours in the
state in which they were, when presented to the Queen,
with the wreath placed upon them by her Majesty.</p>

<p class="indent">The colours of the second battalion of the 24th had
been left in camp when the troops advanced to meet the
Zulus, and they were consequently captured. No trace
of them could be found till some time afterwards when
the pole with its crown was recovered by a party of
the 17th Lancers in a Zulu kraal near Ulundi. This
remnant continued to be carried by the regiment for
upwards of a year, when new colours were presented
to them at Gibraltar on behalf of the Queen by Lord
Napier of Magdala. The old colours, or rather their
pole with the crown, were first trooped. The new
colours were then uncovered, and, after consecration, presented&mdash;Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
Napier stating that her Majesty knew
very well that the flag had not been lost through any
default of the battalion, but only in consequence of
their having been placed in camp when the battalion
went to the front under the general commanding.</p>

<p class="indent">The presentation of new colours with the accompanying
consecration service is an interesting ceremony.
As the form may not be generally known, I shall describe
a recent one when new colours were presented
by the Prince of Wales to the first battalion of the
23d Regiment (the Royal Welsh Fusiliers) on their
embarkation for India. It is specially interesting in
connection with the history of the old ragged colours
which were then superseded. They had been presented
by the late Prince Consort thirty-one years before, and
in the Crimea they were the first which were planted on
the heights of the Alma. Two lieutenants were successively
shot while holding them, and they were finally
seized by Sergeant O'Connor, who, though wounded,
held them aloft and rallied the regiment. For this service
he was decorated with the Victoria cross. Shortly afterwards
he received his commission, and subsequently he
became colonel of the battalion. On the recent arrival
of the troops at Portsmouth they were drawn up on the
military recreation ground, and the Prince and Princess
of Wales having taken their place at the saluting point,
the regiment marched past, headed by the goat which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
always accompanies it. The old colours were then
trooped and conveyed to the rear, and three sides of a
square having been formed, with a pyramid of the drums
in the centre, the new colours were uncased. The royal
party then advanced, and the senior chaplain of the regiment
read the Consecration service. The Queen's colours
and the regimental colours were then handed to the
prince, and he presented them to the two lieutenants who
received them kneeling. The prince having spoken a
few appropriate words, and the colonel having replied, the
colours were saluted by the whole regiment. Another
march past, and the presentation of the officers to the
prince, concluded the ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent">In the cavalry the standards of regiments of Dragoon
Guards are of crimson silk damask, embroidered and
fringed with gold, and their guidons, anciently called
&quot;guydhomme&quot;&mdash;a swallow-tailed flag&mdash;are of crimson
silk. Each is inscribed with the peculiar devices, distinctions,
and mottoes of the regiment. The standards
and guidons of cavalry are carried by troop sergeant-majors.
The Hussars and Lancers have no standards.
They were discontinued, for what reason I do not know,
by William IV., and their badges and devices are now
borne on their appointments. Neither the Royal Engineers
nor the Rifles have colours. Neither have the
Royal Artillery; nor is it necessary that they should have
any on which to record special services, for the Artillery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
is represented in every action. Their appropriate motto,
<i>Ubique</i>, is borne on their appointments. None of the
Volunteer regiments carries colours.</p>

<p class="indent">The queen's and regimental colours always parade with
the regiment. On march they are cased, but they are
always uncased when carried into action.</p>

<p class="indent">For military authorities &quot;when embarked in boats or
other vessels,&quot; there is, as we have seen, a special flag.
It is the Union with the royal initials in the centre on
a blue circle, surrounded by a green garland, and surmounted
by the imperial crown.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="x18" id="x18"></a>USE OF FLAGS BY PRIVATE PERSONS.</h2>

<p class="indent">In regard to the use of the national flag by private
persons, there is a positive rule as to marine flags, but
none, so far as I am aware, as to its use on shore. I have
occasionally seen it flown on shore with a white border,
under an impression, apparently, that this difference was
necessary, but it is unmeaning, and there is no authority
for it. In numberless instances we see one or other of
the marine Ensigns hoisted on shore over gentlemen's
houses, or used in street decoration on the occasion of
public rejoicings; but nothing could be more absurd, as
the ensign is exclusively a ship flag.</p>

<p class="indent">Any private individual entitled to armorial bearings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
may carry them on a flag. In such cases the arms should
not be on a shield, but filling the entire flag.</p>

<p class="indent">The flags and banners represented in works on heraldry
have almost invariably a fringe; but this is optional. If a
fringe is used it should be composed of the livery colours,
each tincture of the arms giving its colour to the portion
of the fringe which adjoins it. In the British army the
colours of the different regiments are fringed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="x19" id="x19"></a>FOREIGN FLAGS: FRANCE.</h2>

<p class="indent">My notice of foreign flags must be short. Those
of France and America have naturally most interest
for us.</p>

<p class="indent">Previous to the Revolution the French can hardly be
said to have had a national flag. The colours of the
reigning families&mdash;changing as they did with each fresh
dynasty, as was the case in our own early history&mdash;were
accepted in the place of national standards, while each
regiment in the army followed colours of its own. The
celebrated <i>Chape de Saint Martin de Tours</i> and the
<i>Oriflamme</i> of the Abbey of Saint Denis, were, like the
labarum of Constantine, ecclesiastical banners, symbolic
of the two patrons of Christian France watching over her
in her battles. The Chape de Saint Martin was a banner
imitating in form a cape or cloak, and was of blue. The
Oriflamme was red with a green fringe. By the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
the tenth century this had become
the royal standard. In
one of the windows of the Cathedral
of Chartres (of the
thirteenth century) there is a representation
of Henri Sieur de
Argentin et du Mez, Marshall of
France under St. Louis, receiving
from the hands of St. Denis a
banner which is supposed to be
the Oriflamme. Fig. 30 is a copy
of this interesting old work of art.
The banner, it will be observed,
has five points; but in other examples
it has only three, each having
attached to it a tassel of green
silk.</p>

<p class="indent">The royal banner of St. Louis
was blue powdered with fleurs-de-lis
in gold, and these fleurs-de-lis
have remained since the
eleventh or twelfth century a peculiarly
French and royal device. It
is indeed one of extreme antiquity,
the emblem of a long-forgotten
worship&mdash;older by many
ages than any record of the doctrine of the Trinity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
of which some have supposed this flower to be an emblem.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="indent">In the reign of Charles VI. the blue field ceased to be
<i>powdered</i> with fleurs-de-lis, and was charged with three
only&mdash;two and one. The white flag which became the
standard of the kings of France was probably not introduced
till the reign of Henry IV. But there is great
confusion in the history of the French flags, and this is
increased by the use of personal colours at sea, which continued
among the French to a much later period than
among the English. In the colours of the French regiments
there has been great variety of design. Under
the old monarchy the regimental colours were of two
kinds&mdash;one was the <i>drapeau-colonel</i>, or royal; the other,
called <i>drapeau d'ordonnance</i>, took its device from the
founder of the particular regiment which carried it, or
from the province of its origin. A common form of the
royal colours was a white cross on a blue field. In other
examples, sometimes the cross and sometimes the field
were powdered with fleurs-de-lis. In some instances the
field was green. The flag displayed by the French in
1789 was a white cross on a blue ground, with one fleur-de-lis
at each corner of the field, and the motto &quot;Patrie et
Liberté.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Tricolour was introduced at the Revolution, but the
origin of the design is unknown. Possibly a trace of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
may be found in an illumination in one of the MS. copies
of Froissart. It represents the King of France setting
out against the Duke of Brittany, and his majesty is preceded
by a man on horseback bearing a swallow-tailed
pennon, the first part containing the ancient arms of
France, and each of the tails&mdash;composed of three stripes&mdash;red,
white, and green.</p>

<p class="indent">For some time after the Revolution the white field was
retained. When the three colours came to be used there
appears to have been at first no fixed order in arranging
them, and in some cases they were placed vertically, and in
others horizontally. By a decree in 1790 it was ordained
that in the navy the flag on the bowsprit&mdash;the jack&mdash;should
be composed of three equal bands placed vertically,
that next the staff being red, the middle white, and the
third blue. The flag at the stem was to have in a canton
the jack above described (occupying one fourth of the
flag), and to be surrounded by a narrow band, the half of
which was to be red and the other blue, and the rest of
the flag to be white. In 1794 this flag was abolished,
and it was ordered &quot;that the national flag shall be formed
of <i>the three national colours</i> in equal bands placed vertically,
the hoist being blue, the centre white, and the fly
red.&quot; It would appear, however, that this arrangement
was not for some time universally adopted, and that old
flags continued to be used. Thus, in the great picture
by De Loutherbourg at Greenwich, the French ships are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
represented as wearing the suppressed flag of 1790; while,
in a rare print preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale at
Paris, representing the magnificent ceremony at which the
first Napoleon distributed eagles to the troops in 1804, the
banners suspended over the Ecole Militaire in the Champ
de Mars, where the ceremony took place, show the three
colours in fess, that is, in horizontal lines. But the vertical
arrangement must have been soon afterwards generally
adopted, and this continued to be the flag both of
the French army and navy during the Empire. On the
return of the king in 1814, and again in 1815, it was
abolished, and the white flag restored; but the Tricolour
was reintroduced in 1830, and it has remained in use
since.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p class="indent">When the Emperor Napoleon assumed the sovereignty
of Elba he had a special flag made. It will be recollected
that he was allowed to retain the title of emperor, and
although the island which comprised his dominions was
only sixty miles in circumference, the inhabitants barely
12,000, his household 35 persons, and his entire army
only 700 infantry and 60 cavalry, he considered it necessary
to have a &quot;national flag.&quot; According to Sir Walter
Scott, it bore on a white field a bend charged with three
bees. But the emperor was preparing another and very
different flag for his small army, of which I am able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
give a representation from a very rare coloured engraving.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
It was the tricolour of France, composed of the richest
silk with the ornaments elaborately embroidered in silver.
It bore the imperial crown with the letter N, and the
eagle, on each of the blue and red
portions, with the imperial bees; and
over all the inscription, &quot;L'Empereur
Napoléon à la Garde Nationale de
L'lle d'Elbe.&quot; To the staff, the top
of which was surmounted by a golden
eagle, was suspended a tricoloured
sash also richly embroidered in silver.
This splendid standard was presented
by Napoleon to his guards in
Elba shortly before his invasion of
France in 1815. On the reverse side
there was subsequently embroidered the inscription,
&quot;Champ de Mai&quot;&mdash;the flag having been a second time
presented by the emperor to his guards at that celebrated
meeting, a short time before they marched for Waterloo.
The standard was captured by the Prussians, and on their
entering Paris was sold to an English gentleman who
brought it to England.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The lately-abolished Eagle (Fig. 31) was borne as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
standard in the French army during the Empire only.
It was introduced by Napoleon I., who adopted it
from the Romans. The ribbon attached was of silk
five inches wide and three feet long, and richly embroidered.
After Napoleon's fall the eagles were abandoned,
but they were again introduced by Napoleon III.
In consequence of their intrinsic value, they proved in
the Franco-German war a much-coveted prize among
the Germans, who captured a considerable number of
them on the successive defeats of the French. The first
Napoleon was very careful of the Eagles. He himself
tells us, in one of the conversations at St. Helena, that
he established in each regiment two subaltern officers as

The latter has <i>the metal</i>, the white, uppermost,

notions of heraldic propriety&mdash;placed together below.

<h2><a name="x20" id="x20"></a>THE AMERICAN FLAG.</h2>

<p class="indent">The history of the American flag is interesting. Previous
to the Declaration of Independence the different
colonies retained the standards of the mother country
with the addition of some local emblem. Massachusetts,
for example, adopted the pine-tree, a device which was
also placed on the coins. In 1775 &quot;the Union with a
red field&quot;&mdash;a red ensign&mdash;was displayed at New York on
a liberty poll with the inscription, &quot;George Rex and the
Liberties of America;&quot; and it is interesting to note that
the first flag adopted as a national ensign by the ships of
the United States consisted of the horizontal stripes with
which we are familiar, but with the British Union still
retained in a canton. This was replaced by the stars on
a blue ground. Some of the flags first used&mdash;at the time
when only twelve states had ratified the articles of convention&mdash;bore
only twelve stars. On the 14th of August,
1777, Congress resolved &quot;that the flag of the United
States be thirteen stripes alternately red and white, and
that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field,
representing a new constellation.&quot; (See Fig. 32.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
It has been said that the design of the flag was derived
from arms borne by the family of Washington; but there
is no foundation for this. An American writer&mdash;with
probably as little ground for the statement&mdash;says: &quot;the
blue field was taken from the Covenanters' banner in
Scotland, likewise significant of the League and Covenant
of the United Colonies against oppression, and incidentally
involving vigilance, perseverance, and justice. The stars
were then disposed in a circle symbolizing the perpetuity
of the union, as well as equality with themselves. The
whole was a blending of the various flags used previous
to the war, viz. the red flags of the army and white
colours of the floating batteries&mdash;the gem of the navy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In 1795 it was ordained that the stripes should be increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
to fifteen and the stars to the same number; but
in 1818 Congress ordered a return to the thirteen stripes
but with twenty stars, and that on the admission of any
new state a star should be added. Thus the old number
of stripes perpetuated the original number of the states
forming the union, while the added stars show the union
in its existing state. In consequence of the greatly increased
number of stars, the circular arrangement had to
be abandoned, and they are now disposed in parallel lines.
(See flag of the United States, Plate V. No. 8.) The
construction of the first national standard, from which
the stars and stripes were afterwards adopted, took
place at Philadelphia in 1777 under the personal direction
of Washington aided by a committee of Congress.</p>

<p class="indent">The flag of the American admirals is composed of the
stripes alone, and the stars are used separately as a jack.
One of the first American flags used at sea, and bearing
only the twelve stars, is still preserved. It is the flag
which was flown by the celebrated Paul Jones from his
privateer, the <i>Bon homme Richard</i>, in his engagement with
the English ship <i>Serapis</i> on 23d September, 1799. In
the course of the action the flag having been shot away
from the mast-head, Lieutenant Stafford, then a volunteer
in Paul Jones' ship, leaped into the sea after it, and recovered
and replaced it, being severely wounded while
performing this action. The flag thus saved was afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
presented to him by the marine committee of
Congress, and it now (1880) belongs to his son.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p class="indent">I may mention that the white and red stripes are not
peculiar to the American flag. A flag of similar design
was for a long time a well-known signal in the British
navy, being that used for the red division to draw into
line of battle.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="x21" id="x21"></a>OTHER FOREIGN FLAGS.</h2>

<p class="indent">The flag of Liberia is very like that of the United States,
being composed of red and white stripes with a blue
canton. The only difference is that the latter bears only
one star. (See the flag of Liberia, Plate V. No. 6.) The
flag of Bremen is also composed of red and white stripes.</p>

<p class="indent">Spain from the first period of her greatness bore the
Castilian flag, quartering Castile and Leon. In an old
illumination representing the coronation of Henry, son of
John, King of Castile, there are on the king's left hand
two men, unarmed, the one holding a banner of Castile
and Leon quarterly, the other a blue pennon charged
with three kings' heads-the banner of the three kings of
Cologne. On his majesty's right hand a man, also unarmed,
holds a shield with the arms of Castile and Leon.
It was this last device, as a national flag, that was carried
by the ships of Columbus. But Columbus had also as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
a personal flag one given to him by Queen Isabella&mdash;a
white swallow-tailed pennon bearing a Latin cross in
green between the letters FY crowned. These two flags
are noteworthy as the first that crossed the Atlantic.</p>

<p class="indent">The present royal standard of Spain is of very complicated
construction (see Plate V. No. 1), embracing
among its bearings the arms of Castile and Leon, of
Aragon, Sicily, Burgundy, and others. The national
ensign is in marked contrast by its simplicity. It is composed
of yellow and red stripes&mdash;derived from the bars
of Aragon. (See Plate V. No. 2.)</p>

<p class="indent">Austria at first bore on her flag the Roman eagle.
Now her war ensign is red, white, and red placed horizontally,
and in the centre a shield of the same within a
gold border (the arms of the Dukes of Austria), surmounted
by the royal crown. (See Plate V. No. 3.) The
merchant flag is the same without the shield and crown.
The Austro-Hungarian flag has the lower stripe half red
and half green, with two shields, one on the right containing
the arms of Austria, and the other bearing the
arms of Hungary. (See Plate V. No. 4.)</p>

<p class="indent">The flag of Italy was designed by Napoleon I. on his
declaration of the Kingdom of Italy. It is a modification
of the French, the division of the field next the staff being,
instead of blue, green, which, it is known, was a favourite
colour of the emperor. In the centre is a red shield
charged with a white cross&mdash;the arms of the Dukes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
Savoy, now borne by Italy. A representation of the
Italian merchant flag will be found on Plate V. No. 5.
The war ensign is the same, except that the shield is
surmounted by the royal crown.</p>

<p class="indent">In the construction of the flag of Norway, curiously
enough, the same blunder has been committed as in our
own Union. It is &quot;described&quot; as a blue cross <i>fimbriated</i>
white; but the border, as the flag is worn, is too broad,
and it really represents two crosses, a blue cross superimposed
on a white one&mdash;just as our St. George's cross,
as represented in our national colours, is nothing but a
red cross superimposed on a white one. Mr. Laughton
accordingly looking at the Norwegian flag in this light,
calls it the white flag of Denmark with a blue cross
over it,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> which it was certainly not intended to be. The
flag is shown in Plate V. No. 11. The Swedish-Norwegian
union in the canton was introduced in 1817, when
the two countries were united under one king.</p>

<p class="indent">The Danish flag (see Plate V. No. 7) is the oldest now
in existence. The tradition is that it descended from
Heaven ready made in the year 1219 in answer to the
prayer of King Waldemar, as he was leading his troops
to battle against the pagans of the Baltic. Be that as it
may, it certainly dates from the thirteenth century.</p>

<p class="indent">The flag of Portugal has borne a conspicuous part
in history, and the devices in it carry us back to a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
early period. The present royal standard is red with
a red shield in the centre charged with towers or castles
for the kingdom of Algarve, which Alphonsus III. got
from the King of Castile when he married the daughter
of the latter in 1278; and in the centre there is a white
shield bearing on it the shields of the five Moors placed
crossways. The Portuguese national flag is per pale,
blue and white, and in the centre point is the same device
as appears on the royal standard. The present flag, however,
is only a modification of the old flag which was
carried by the early discoverers, and which brought glory
to Portugal in the days of Prince Henry the Navigator.
(See the national flag of Portugal, Plate V. No. 12.)</p>

<p class="indent">The royal standards of Norway and Sweden, and also
the ensign of these kingdoms, are peculiar in preserving
the ancient form of having the fly ending in three points.
(See the Swedish standard, Plate V. No. 10.)</p>

<p class="indent">Greece has adopted the colours of Bavaria in compliment
to her first king. (See Plate VI. No. 7.)</p>

<p class="indent">The devices on some of the Asiatic flags are peculiar.
That of Burmah bears a peacock; Siam, a white elephant;
and China, a hideous-looking dragon. (See these flags,
Plate VI. Nos. 1, 2, 3.) On the flag of Bolivia (Plate VI.
No. 4) is the representation of a volcano, suggested in all
probability by the great volcano of Serhama, which rises
in Western Bolivia to the height of 23,000 feet. Japan,
the land of the far east, the source of the sun, as her name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
signifies, has adopted for her flag the sun rising blood-red.
(See Plate V. No. 9.)</p>

<p class="caption">NATIONAL FLAGS AND STANDARDS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLATE VI.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">The flag of Brazil, which is very inartistic in its construction,
bears among other devices the armillary sphere
of Portugal. (See Plate VI. No. 8.)</p>

<p class="indent">In Plates IV. V. and VI. will be found representations
of the flags of other kingdoms and republics. These
speak for themselves, and do not call for particular
description.</p>

<p class="indent">But I must now bring these notices to a close. To the
true patriot of every country the national flag must be a
subject of pride. If, as a French writer observes, it does
not always lead him to victory, it inspires him to fight
well, and if need be to die well. &quot;We pay to it,&quot; says the
same writer, &quot;royal honours. When it is paraded&mdash;in rags
it may be, and with faded colours, bearing in letters of
gold the names of victories&mdash;the troops present arms, the
officers salute it with the sword, and the white heads of
veteran generals are uncovered and bent before the
ensign.&quot; To the soldier its loss is one of the greatest
calamities. In Napoleon's disastrous retreat from Moscow
in 1812 not many of his flags remained with the Russians.
Of those which were not carried off most were burned,
and of some of these the officers drank the ashes. More
recently the same thing is said to have been done at
Metz and Sedan. So a French writer tells us, and he
characterizes the act as &quot;<i>communion sublime</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
What the flag is, indeed, to the sailor and the soldier,
whether when shaken out in battle or when displayed in
memory of great victories, none but the soldier and the
sailor can realize. At the interment of Lord Nelson,
when his flag was about to be lowered into the grave, the
sailors who assisted at the ceremony ran forward with one
accord and tore it into small pieces, to be preserved as
sacred relics. &quot;I know,&quot; says Charles Kingsley&mdash;in those
<i>Brave Words</i> which he addressed to our soldiers then
fighting in the trenches before Sebastopol, &quot;I know
that you would follow those colours into the mouth of the
pit; that you would die twice over rather than let them
be taken. Those noble rags, inscribed with noble names
of victory, should remind you every day and every hour
that he who fights for Queen and country in a just cause
is fighting not only in the Queen's army but in Christ's
army, and that he shall in no wise lose his reward.&quot;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
